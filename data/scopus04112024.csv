The Cyclist Motivation Instrument (CMI) was used as a model that measures cycling motivations with the social-ecological theory as the foundation. Results show that those who are more active and participate in tours are more likely to attend a major cycling event, having a higher level of participation and engagement. More attention should be given to the increasing involvement of women in the events. Event managers and local administration could optimize these events as platforms for social interaction. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Miklos Banhidi and Farhad Moghimehfar.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of a long-term individualized home-based endurance training (IHET) on a bicycle ergometer in combination with inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in pediatric and adult patients after Fontan palliation. Additionally, factors influencing the trainability of Fontan palliated patients were analyzed. Methods: From 2018 to 2021 a single-center prospective study was performed initially including 25 Fontan palliated patients. During study period nine patients were excluded due to incompliance. A Magbike® bicycle ergometer (DKN Technology, France) was used for IHET and a POWERbreathe® Medic plus device (HaB GmbH, Germany) was utilized for the IMT. Over the study period, bike training was increased from 90 min of basic endurance training per week to additional 25 min of interval training per week. IMT consisted of 30 breaths per day for 6–7 days per week with pressure adaption over time. Patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and body plethysmography including measurement of respiratory muscle strength at baseline and at follow-up examinations at 4, 10 and 22 months. Results: Follow-up examinations were completed by 18/25 patients (72.0%) at 4 and 10 months and 16/25 patients (64.0%) at 22 months. Median exercise capacity slightly increased by 0.13 W/kg from baseline to last follow-up (p = 0.055, 95%CI: 0.0–0.36). However, a significant increase of oxygen pulse of 0.7 ml/beat (p = 0.006, 95%CI: 0.38–2.22) was detectable. IMT significantly improved respiratory function with an increase of inspiratory vital capacity (VCin/reference) by 4.0% (p = 0.016, 95%CI: 0.8–8). Median maximal inspiratory pressure increased by 1.2 kPa (p = 0.003, 95%CI: 0.64–3.19) and expiratory pressure by 1.5 kPa (p = 0.036, 95%CI: 0.08–2.29). No adverse events or unplanned interventions occurred during the study. Patients' subjective quality of life did not significantly change over the study period. Conclusion: In Fontan palliated patients, IHET in combination with IMT leads to a significant increase in oxygen pulse, inspiratory vital capacity as well as median maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure but not to significant improvement of quality of life. Fontan patients should be encouraged to perform regular home-based exercise training. 2024 Walzer, Sallmon, Kelm, Dirks, Meyer, Kramer, Wolfarth, Thouet, Ovroutski, Berger and Schleiger.","Fontan circulation; home-based training; inspiratory muscle training; pediatric and adult Fontan patients; physical endurance training","beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; adolescent; adult; anxiety; Article; balloon dilatation; body composition; body mass; body plethysmography; cardiopulmonary exercise test; child; circulation; clinical article; color Doppler flowmetry; echocardiography; endurance; endurance training; exercise; fat mass; female; fenestration; follow up; Fontan circulation; Fontan procedure; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; heart catheterization; heart failure; heart rate; hemodynamics; home based training; human; inspiratory muscle training; long term physical endurance; male; maximal expiratory pressure; maximal inspiratory pressure; maximal oxygen uptake; muscle strength; muscle training; New York Heart Association class; oxygen consumption; oxygen saturation; peak oxygen uptake; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; physical activity; physical capacity; prospective study; quality of life; questionnaire; respiratory function; total lung capacity; young adult","","","GraphPad Prism version 10.1.2. for Windows, Graphpad, United States; Magbike bicycle ergometer, DKN Technology, France; POWERbreathe Medic plus device, HaB GmbH, Germany; Stata software version 18.0, StataCorp, United States","DKN Technology, France; Graphpad, United States; HaB GmbH, Germany; StataCorp, United States","Stiftung KinderHerz Deutschland gGmbH","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Those participating in it range from novices to professionals, the homeless to billionaires. Notwithstanding the vast numbers of participants, spectators and other bystanders present at road-running events, very few injuries and fatalities have thus far been recorded, and then exclusively in respect of participants. Cases of injuries or fatalities to spectators and bystanders can rather be expected in other forms of sport and recreation such as cricket, rugby, golf and car races, although our jurisprudence is devoid of any such examples, with one exception, namely Clark v Welsh (1975 4 SA 469 (W); 1976 3 SA 484 (A)), containing extensive obiter dicta applicable to spectator injuries. In the USA there have been some development regarding the law applicable to spectator injuries, while English law contains only a few judgments dealing specifically with this topic. In both American and English law it would appear that delictual liability for the causing of injury to spectators and other bystanders is mostly dependent on a finding of negligence, although the doctrine of YROHQWL QRQ ¿W LQLXULD also features in some cases. In the case at hand, Kalmer, a well-known top South African Olympian, seriously injured a spectator/ bystander, Salie, who had negligently stepped into the runners’ path, by running into her at full speed during the annual Spar ladies’ race in Cape Town. In the Cape Town high court Salie failed in her damages claim against both Western Province Athletics who had organised the event, and Kalmer. The court found no negligence in the conduct of both defendants. Salie subsequently passed away and her appeal to the full Cape court was brought by Davids in her capacity as executrix of the latter’s deceased estate. The appeal partially succeeded, as the court found Kalmer to have been negligent. The court issued an order based on section 1(1)(a) of the Apportionment of Damages Act in terms of which the appellant could recover only 30 per cent of proven damages in view of a finding of 70 per cent contributory negligence on Salie's part. Gamble J first dealt with the claim against Kalmer. After meticulously analysing the evidence, he found that she had been negligent because she could have avoided the accident by keeping a better lookout – based on case law applicable to the drivers of motor vehicles in collision cases, with reference inter alia to drivers’ reaction times. Furthermore, it was held that the injured Salie had not been a spectator in the strict sense of the word, but an occasional bystander, rendering the case law applicable to spectators useless. It is argued that the court erred in this regard, mainly because the analogy drawn between the conduct of an athlete such as Kalmer and the driver of a motor vehicle in ordinary traffic is a strained one. A better analogy would have been that of a racing driver during the Monte Carlo F1 race, or a cyclist in the Tour de France contest. Furthermore, the court contradicted itself in characterising Salie as a disconnected bystander on the one hand, and someone fully aware of her surroundings on the other hand. It is further argued that the outcome of this appeal would mean that top athletes who have developed a successful running style over a prolonged period – which style has the effect that they cannot keep a proper lookout over longer distances as in this case - would have to adapt their style according to the specific venues of events, which is unacceptable as it would adversely affect their performance. Although the court favoured Kalmer (or her insurer) with its reduction of the amount of damages to be proven by 70 per cent, she was held responsible for the appellant’s legal costs. Furthermore, the reduced amount of damages will probably still be considerable. This is an extremely unfair outcome for a top performer who merely exercised her sport in an accepted way to achieve her best performance. It is suggested that Kalmer should have presented expert evidence on the effect of running style and related factors on performance, which would have enabled her to prove that her style was acceptable and should not have been found to form the basis of negligence. © Juta and Company (Pty) Ltd.","","","","","","","","","","","","Juta and Company Ltd","","","","","","02577747","","","","Afrikaans","Tydskr.

With the widespread use of ICT devices, secondary tasks have become a major focus for transport safety research. They have also been identified as a predictor of collision. Although still scarce, this literature on cyclists’ secondary tasks identifies a recurrent profile. Young cyclists are in the spotlight as they often use earbuds or headphones and combine such use with taking other major risks on the road. Despite their vulnerability, their group accounts for only 12% of severe fatalities, which is proportional to their share of the urban cyclist population. This paper explores other cyclist profiles in an attempt to understand the discrepancy between the perception of risk-prone behaviour and transport safety statistics. Methods: We seek to establish more nuanced profiles, i.e. cyclists who balance risk-taking and safety. In order to detect these profiles, we conducted 1746 observations at 14 locations in the city of Besançon (France). For each observation we considered 30 variables that provide information on the cyclist's profile, secondary tasks, risks taken, and safety equipment. Results: These observed situations show that the two well-documented profiles (i.e. ‘risk-prone’ or ‘risk-averse’) together represent only 53.84% of our observations. We identify more mitigated profiles. Primarily a large group (37.29%) consists of middle-aged and elderly cyclists who are poorly equipped, who are rarely engaged in any secondary tasks, but who take occasional risks on the road. Conclusions: Policies that aim to reduce the use of ICT devices on bike for all are necessary but not sufficient for reducing collisions. In addition to providing dedicated infrastructure, more targeted responses need to be provided to these different groups, such as focused actions on safety equipment and compliance with the traffic regulations for elderly cyclists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bike safety; Compensation effects; Observational study; Risk-taking; Safety equipment; Secondary tasks","","","","","","Conseil régional de Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, (2019-Y-09065)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: the observational survey was supported by the Conseil Régional Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (grant ANER n° 2019-Y-09065 ).

The paper presents a thematic literature review focused on gender inclusion in bike-sharing schemes. The proposed methodological approach is based on (i) Geographic Information Systems for the analysis of geolocated open datasets related to land, sociodemographic and mobility characteristics of the areas surrounding each docking stations. This was aimed at identifying a short list of suitable bike-sharing docking stations, which were further characterized through: (ii) structured proprietary data focused on travel demand; (iii) onsite observations focused on universal design indicators; (iv) survey questionnaires focused on women’s concerns, needs and expectations; and (v) social media data from Twitter focused on the opinion of the end-users. Results showed that women use the VELIB’s bike-sharing service much less than men (about 30% of the total number of users), since they are more concerned about the following issues: accessibility (e.g., availability of bikes at the docking stations, distance to the nearest station, type and quality of the cycle paths); safety and security (e.g., perception of danger and insecurity while cycling and using the current bicycle infrastructures); social constraints (e.g., perceptions and cultural stigmatization associated with cycling and bike-sharing); weather and topography (e.g., impact of weather and the urban terrain on cycling and bike-sharing). The final aim of the H2020 DIAMOND project is to support the definition of guidelines and policies for the inclusion of women’s needs in the design of future bike-sharing services. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, this paper aims to review three of the bike sharing systems located in places with high demand for this service, such as the systems of Shanghai (China), Vélib’-Paris (France), and EnCicla-Medellín (Colombia), through the methodology of systematic literature review and the analysis of how the use of bicycles reduces the carbon footprint. Eighty percent of the publications were made in the last seven years between 2015 and 2022, which shows the growing interest in the topic and little publication before 2015. Among the findings, it was determined that the publications respond to studies on the history of bike sharing systems; methods to improve the distribution of bicycles; negative effects of systems without stations (dockless); positive contribution to the environment and to the health of users. Also, it is found that the bicycle is the vehicle that most reduces the carbon footprint in daily mobility. It is concluded that it is pertinent to expand knowledge about these systems and some aspects are recommended for the operation of the EnCicla-Medellín system in the face of the challenges of sustainable mobility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bike sharing systems; Collaborative economy; Sustainable mobility","","","","","","","","Blog Vélib; Bejarano M., Ceballos L.M., Maya J., A user-centred assessment of a new bicycle sharing system in Medellin, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 44, pp. 145-158, (2017); Campbell K.B., Brakewood C., Sharing riders: How bikesharing impacts bus ridership in New York City, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 100, pp. 264-282, (2017); Chen R., “Bike litter” and obligations of the platform operators: Lessons from China’s dockless sharing bikes, Computer Law & Security Review, 35, 5, (2019); Chen Y., Wang D., Chen K., Zha Y., Bi G., Optimal pricing and availability strategy of a bike-sharing firm with time-sensitive customers, Journal of Cleaner Production, 228, pp. 208-221, (2019); Cheng P., Ouyang Z., Liu Y., Understanding bike sharing use over time by employing extended technology continuance theory, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 124, pp. 433-443, (2019); Chester M.V., Horvath A., Madanat S., Comparison of life-cycle energy and emissions footprints of passenger transportation in metropolitan regions, Atmospheric Environment, 44, 8, pp. 1071-1079, (2010); Feng Y., Affonso R.C., Zolghadri M., Analysis of bike sharing system by clustering: The Vélib’ case, Ifac-Papersonline, 50, 1, pp. 12422-12427, (2017); Gu T., Kim I., Currie G., To be or not to be dockless: Empirical analysis of dockless bikeshare development in China, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 119, pp. 122-147, (2019); BFMTV; Johansson J., Collaborative governance for sustainable forestry in the emerging bio-based economy in Europe, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 32, pp. 9-16, (2018); Lan J., Ma Y., Mangalagiu D., Thornton T., Enabling value co-creation in the sharing economy: The case of mobike, Sustainability, (2017); Liu Z., Jia X., Cheng W., Solving the last mile problem: Ensure the success of public bicycle system in Beijing, Procedia—Social and Behavioural Sciences, 43, pp. 73-78, (2012); Nair R., Miller-Hooks E., Hampshire R., Busic A., Large-scale vehicle sharing systems: Analysis of Vélib’, International Journal of Sustainable Transportation—INT J SUSTAIN TRANSP, (2012); Parkes S.D., Marsden G., Shaheen S.A., Cohen A.P., Understanding the diffusion of public bikesharing systems: Evidence from Europe and North America, Journal of Transport Geography, 31, pp. 94-103, (2013); Qiu L.-Y., He L.-Y., Bike sharing and the economy, the environment, and health-related externalities, Sustainability, 10, 4, (2018); Randriamanamihaga A.N., Come E., Oukhellou L., Govaert G., Clustering the Vélib’ dynamic Origin/Destination flows using a family of Poisson mixture models, Neurocomputing, 141, pp. 124-138, (2014); Saraiva P.P., Ribeiro L.A., Passo Fundo Vai de Bici: A redução no consumo de combustíveis fósseis e as contribuições para o meio ambiente, Revista De Arquitetura IMED, 6, 1, pp. 62-73, (2017); Shaheen S.A., Guzman S., Zhang H., Bicicletas compartidas en Europa, América y Asia: Pasado, presente y futuro, Transportation Research Record, 2143, 1, pp. 159-167, (2010); Shi J., Si H., Wu G., Su Y., Lan J., Critical factors to achieve dockless bike-sharing sustainability in China: A stakeholder-oriented network perspective, Sustainability, 10, 6, (2018); Tironi M., (De)politicising and ecologising bicycles, Journal of Cultural Economy, 8, pp. 1-18, (2014); Wang J., Huang J., Dunford M., Rethinking the utility of public bicycles: The development and challenges of station-less bike sharing in China, Sustainability, 11, 6, (2019); Watson R.T., Boudreau M.-C., Chen A.J., Sepulveda H.H., Green projects: An information drives analysis of four cases, The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 20, 1, pp. 55-62, (2011); Zhang Y., Mi Z., Environmental benefits of bike sharing: A big data-based analysis, Applied Energy, 220, pp. 296-301, (2018); Zhang Y., Lin D., Mi Z., Electric fence planning for dockless bike-sharing services, Journal of Cleaner Production, 206, pp. 383-393, (2019); Zhang L., Zhang J., Duan Z., Bryde D., Sustainable bike-sharing systems: Characteristics and commonalities across cases in urban China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 97, pp. 124-133, (2015)","L.L.

The decision variables such as arduousness index and urgency are determined. The arduousness index is carried out from the GPS ride data. Urgency is calculated using the parking time and ebike batteries state of charge. They are used to determine ebike's charging priorities at the charging station using continue fuzzy logic. Photovoltaic power forecasting is determined over the control horizon using the artificial neural network. On the one hand, the values of the priority, the photovoltaic power forecasting and the storage battery's state of charge are calculated. They allow to control the states of the switches associated with each charging spot and the operating mode of the storage battery (source or load) using discrete fuzzy logic. On the other hand, the interest of the ride's arduousness for a charging station is presented. A comparative study between the charging method integrating the ride arduousness and not is carried out. A case study of the polytech Annecy campus at the University of Savoie Mont Blanc in France is proposed. Results show that: the arduousness index is essential for controlling the charging priority of ebikes at the charging station; Fuzzy logic allows to manage the current dispatching on a charging station; taking into account the ride's arduousness allows to save up to 413.03 (Wh) of profit and 97.90% energy flexibility on the charging station. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Arduouness index; Automatic dispatching;

Universal use of bicycle helmets by children could prevent between 135 and 155 deaths, and between 39,000 and 45,000 head injuries annually. surprisingly, epidemiologic data indicate a worldwide low prevalence of helmet use. a global view on the law on the compulsory use of safety helmets involving 58 different countries is provided in order to bring this critical debate back to the table. A broad search using “bicycle-related injuries,” “bicycle helmet,” “bicycle helmet legislation” and “compulsory bicycle helmet law by countries” was performed in order to identify and select the most pertinent information on the issue as well as all the information available on bicycle helmet law by countries. the papers identified permitted us to assess the main topics related to the use of bicycle helmets discussed over the years which are still relevant and without consensus even today, as well as alphabetically enlist the approach of 58 countries to the compulsory helmet law. Our review on the many faces of the bicycle helmet use (pros and cons), personal aspects, head injuries, legislation, promotion, socioeconomic influence, and finally a global view on the law on the compulsory use of safety helmets allowed us to bring here many suggestions and a few conclusions, mainly because “to helmet or not to helmet” should not be a question anymore. A universal consensus on their compulsory use has to be achieved in order to improve children’s safety. © 2020 Edizioni Minerva Medica","Bicycling; Child; Craniocerebral trauma; Head protective devices;

Therapeutically, the drug is used as a muscle relaxant under the trade names Sirdalud™ or Zanaflex™. The drug is not prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency but, for therapeutic purposes, can only be obtained via a nominative temporary use authorization. The French public health police requested the laboratory to test for tizanidine in head hair specimens collected from international racing cyclists. Using Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS–MS) and confirmation by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS), after pH 9.5 borate buffer overnight incubation of 20 mg and subsequent solvents extraction, tizanidine was identified in the hair of three athletes at 1.1, 3.7, and 11.1 pg/mg. This is the first evidence that tizanidine is incorporated in human hair. However, it was not possible to interpret the data in terms of doses and frequency of use due to a lack of controlled study. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists; Athletes; Bicycling; Chromatography, Liquid; Clonidine; Doping in Sports; Hair; Humans; Substance Abuse Detection; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Drug products; High pressure liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; diazepam; tizanidine; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; clonidine; tizanidine; Adrenergic receptors; Borate buffer; Drug tests; Human hair; Imidazoline derivatives; Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometries; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; Muscle relaxants; World Anti-Doping Agency; Article; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); cyclist; decontamination; doping; France; hair analysis; human; laboratory test; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; measurement accuracy; pH; police; public health; retention time; solvent extraction; athlete; chemistry; cycling; hair; liquid chromatography; prevention and control; procedures; substance abuse; tandem mass spectrometry; Solvent extraction","","diazepam, 439-14-5, 11100-37-1, 53320-84-6; tizanidine, 51322-75-9, 64461-82-1; clonidine, 4205-90-7, 4205-91-8, 57066-25-8; Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists, ; Clonidine, ; tizanidine, ","","","","","Malanga G., Reiter R.D., Garay E., Update on tizanidine for muscle spasticity and emerging indications, Expert Opin Pharmacother, 9, 12, pp. 2209-2215, (2008); Ketenci A., Ozcan E., Karamursel S., Assessment of efficacy and psychomotor performances of thiocolchicoside and tizanidine in patients with acute low back pain, Int J Clin Pract, 59, 7, pp. 764-770, (2005); Peck J., Urits I., Crane J., Et al., Oral muscle relaxants for the treatment of chronic pain associated with cerebral palsy, Psychopharmacol Bull, 50, 4, pp. 142-162, (2020); Yazicioglu D., Caparlar C., Akkaya T., Mercan U., Kulacoglu H., Tizanidine for the management of acute postoperative pain after inguinal repair: a placebo-controlled double-blind trial, Eur J Anaesthesiol, 33, 3, pp. 215-222, (2016); Rudolf G., Walsh J., Plawman A., Et al., A novel non-opioid protocol for medically supervised opioid withdrawal and transition to antagonist treatment, Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse, 44, 3, pp. 302-309, (2018); Srivastava A.B., Mariani J.J., Levin F.R., New directions in the treatment of opioid withdrawal, Lancet, 395, 10241, pp. 1938-1948, (2020); Khalil R.B., Tizanidine for alcohol withdrawal treatment, Med Hypotheses, 77, 4, pp. 548-549, (2011); Shah J., Wesnes K.A., Kovelsky R.A., Henney H.R., Effects of food on the single-dose pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of tizanidine capsules and tablets in healthy volunteers, Clin Ther, 28, 9, pp. 1308-1317, (2006); Nirogi R.V.S., Kandikere V.N., Shukla M., Mudigonda K., Maurya S., Quantification of tizanidine in human plasma by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom, 20, 15, pp. 2286-2292, (2006); Spiller H.A., Bosse G.M., Adamson L.A., Retrospective review of tizanidine (Zanaflex) overdose, J Toxicol Clin Toxicol, 42, 5, pp. 593-596, (2004); Haukka J., Kriikku P., Mariottini C., Partonen T., Ojanpera I., Non-medical use of psychoactive prescription drugs is associated with fatal poisoning, Addiction, 113, 3, pp. 464-472, (2018); Sklerov J.H., Cox D.E., Moore K.A., Levine B., Fowler D., Tizanidine distribution in a post-mortem case, J Anal Toxicol, 30, 5, pp. 331-334, (2006); Kintz P., Hair analysis in forensic toxicology: an update review with a special focus on pitfalls, Curr Pharm des, 23, 36, pp. 5480-5486, (2017); Kintz P., Gheddar L., Ameline A., Arbouche N., Raul J.S., Hair testing for doping agents.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an outline for the feasibility of implementing PBSS in Bangladesh, particularly in Dhaka city, discussing the major issues that need to be considered. For doing this, PBSS that are already available and operating in six different cities - London, Paris, New York, Buenos Aires, Hangzhou, and New Delhi - were studied and relevant documents were reviewed to understand the salient features of the schemes as well as their overall operating and management systems. By understanding the critical aspects of the PBSS in the above mentioned cities, the implementation process and tasks required for PBSS were assessed with the existing conditions in the case study area of Dhaka city. The detailed scheme of bike-sharing for the case study locations in Dhaka were prepared and analysis was made of the strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) of the proposed scheme. Questionnaire surveys of bicyclists were made to understand their travel patterns as well as deriving their opinions and views regarding the proposed PBSS for the case study locations. Findings of this research will help as the guiding principles for implementing PBSS in Dhaka city as well as in other similar cities in Bangladesh, or in other countries in the Global South. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bikeshare; Cycling; Docking station; Public bike-share scheme (PBSS); SWOT; Travel","Argentina; Bangladesh; Buenos Aires [Federal District]; China; Delhi; Dhaka [Bangladesh]; Dhaka [Dhaka (ADS)]; England; Federal District [Argentina]; France; Hangzhou; Ile de France; India; London [England]; New Delhi; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; Paris; United Kingdom; United States; Ville de Paris; Zhejiang; Surveys; Guiding principles; Implementation process; Management systems; Questionnaire surveys; Relevant documents; Salient features; Strengths , weakness , opportunities , and threats; Travel patterns; cycle transport; feasibility study; implementation process; public transport; travel behavior; urban transport; Bicycles","","","","","Jahangirnagar University Faculty of Social Science; University Grants Committee, UGC","The author acknowledges the efforts and comments of Dr Paul Timms (Senior Research Fellow, Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds, UK) and critical comments from two anonymous reviewers for improving the quality of this paper.

Both, mitigation and adaptation, can be based on collective choices, e.g., investing in less energy-consuming transport means, and/or on individual behavioral changes, e.g., deciding to take less the car and more the bike. Societies on the whole but also individual people vary in their mitigation and/or adaptation-based strategies about climate change in the function of a multitude of variables, such as situational or personal variables. One of these variables, labeled “culture,” has gained attention over the last few years as an essential mediating variable in the human-climate change connect. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to illustrate the relation between culture and climate change from several points of view, conceptual, methodological, and applied, especially in the context of India and France. In conclusion, mindfulness, a cultural concept, is discussed as a possible asset in mitigation and adaptation to climate change over different cultures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

This study analyzed datasets of bicycle crashes in France from 2005 to 2021 extracted from the French national road traffic accident database, evaluating bicycle accident characteristics through conventional descriptive epidemiology approaches and using the K-medoids clustering method to identify typical scenarios and their associated characteristics. Among 1,121,571 road traffic accidents in France, 80,851 were bicycle crashes, with a decline between 2005 and 2013 but a steady increase since then, peaking in 2020 at approximately 1.74 times that of 2005. Victims of bicycle crashes were primarily between 11 and 62 years old, with the largest population among 14–33 years old. Male victims were more involved in bicycle crashes than female victims, with the majority of crashes involving a moving vehicle. The majority of bicyclists involved in accidents were found not wearing helmets, and even bicyclists wearing helmets still sustained injuries. Typical bicycle crash scenarios included four bicycle-vehicle head-on-side collisions, one bicycle-obstacle collision, and two bicycle-pedestrian collisions, with bicycle-obstacle collisions often resulting in serious injuries similar to bicycle-vehicle collisions. Pedestrians were more likely to sustain injuries than bicyclists during bicycle-pedestrian collisions, and their injuries were often more severe than those of bicyclists. The study provides insights into the characteristics and typical scenarios of bicycle crashes in France and can be used to develop targeted interventions to improve road safety for cyclists. © 2024 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies","Bicycle accidents; Cluster analysis; Epidemiology; Injury; Typical crash scenarios","","","","","","Key Area Project for Higher Education Institution of Guangdong Province, (2023ZDZX3028); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52002251); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 52002251) and the Key Area Project for Higher Education Institution of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2023ZDZX3028).

The emergency of the shared mobility concept makes it possible to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by meeting with the decarbonization strategies such as Green Deal and 2030 Agenda. In the near future, it is expected that shared mobility and innovative transport systems will reshape urban mobility by reducing negative impacts on environment and promoting smart and sustainable travel options. More in particular, electric based shared mobility modes could represent the future with being more environment-friendly and energy-efficient. Among different types of shared means of transport, rickshaws have been becoming popular in South-East Asia, which initially involved as human traction, large size, and traditional pedicab tricycles but have evolved into electrified vehicles. Low-cost Chinese models were the first electric rickshaws which become popular. Currently, electric rickshaws are commonly used in many of the countries in Asia, particularly in China, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Some European countries, such as Switzerland, France and Germany, have researched and developed shared electric bike (e-bike) and electric bike taxi (ebike-taxi) services and have been trying to capture the growing market in Asia. The governments in European countries are making serious efforts to improve the number of these mode of transport by making policies such as issuing license with reduced fee. In this paper, the uptake of using shared e-bikes, ebike-taxis and electric rickshaws is presented. The benefits of using these modes in urban areas and the critical issues related to the diffusion are also discussed. This study lays foundation for the improvement of different urban planning and mobility strategies in Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans by providing critical suggestions, which are fundamental for the development of best practices as a guiding tool for local authorities and mobility service providers. © 2022 Author(s).","Decarbonisation strategies; Electric rickshaws; Shared mobility; SUMP","","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (J74I19000320008); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the MIUR (Ministry of Education, Universities and Research [Italy]) through a project entitled WEAKI TRANSIT: WEAK-demand areas Innovative TRANsport Shared services for Italian Towns (Project code: 20174ARRHT /CUP Code: J74I19000320008), financed with the PRIN 2017 (Research Projects of National Relevance) program.

This was epitomized in 2019 when British cyclist and Tour de France winner Chris Froome lost control of his bike at 37 mph while wiping his nose, resulting in an admission to intensive care. We aim to produce a comprehensive resource to guide the assessment and management of rhinitis in athletes.Design:Rhinitis is a common condition which can be broadly divided into allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-AR (NAR), a subset of which is known as vasomotor rhinitis. Exercise-induced rhinitis is an important but understudied subcategory of NAR. The pathophysiology of the disease is broadly believed to be an imbalance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, leading to symptoms of watery rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and paroxysmal sneezing. Up to 50% of people suffer from some degree of EIR, which impedes their nasal breathing and affects performance. The assessment of the athlete with rhinitis requires consideration of both allergic and vasomotor contributions to ensure optimal management is introduced. There is no clear guidance for the management of EIR, with uncertainty regarding the most effective pharmaceuticals and optimizing the timing of treatment to enable peak performance.Setting:N/A.Patients/Participants:N/A.Interventions:N/A.Main Outcome Measures:N/A.Results and Conclusions:Based on expert clinical experience in a busy ear, nose, and throat center and a systematic review of current literature, this article proposes a step-wise, incremental approach to the management of EIR symptoms. In an industry where marginal gains give athletes a competitive edge, optimal management of EIR is crucial. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We aimed to compare the dimensions, distensibility, and prevalence of calcifications in the thoracic aorta between former male professional cyclists (cases) and sex/age-matched controls. Methods We used a retrospective cohort design, where cases were former finishers of at least one Grand Tour (Tour de France, Giro d' Italia or Vuelta a España) and controls were untrained individuals with no previous sports history and free of cardiovascular risk. All participants underwent magnetic resonance and computer tomography assessments for the measurement of aortic dimensions and calcifications, respectively. Results Cases showed larger (P < 0.05) dimensions than controls for aortic annulus, sinus, and arch, as well as for ascending and descending aorta. However, none of the participants presented with pathological aortic dilation (all diameters <40 mm). A slightly higher prevalence of calcifications in the ascending aorta was observed in cases (13% vs 0% in controls, P = 0.020). Subanalyses confirmed that cases who were still competing (masters category, n = 8) had larger aortic diameters (P < 0.05) and a greater presence of calcifications in the ascending/descending aorta (38% vs 0% for both segments, P = 0.032) than those who had become inactive (n = 15). No between-group differences were found for aortic distensibility. Conclusions Former professional cyclists, particularly those who are still competing after retirement, show enlarged aortic diameters (albeit without exceeding upper limits of normality). Former professional cyclists also showed a slightly higher prevalence of calcifications in the ascending aorta than controls, although aortic distensibility was not compromised. The clinical relevance of these findings should be the subject of future studies. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","ATHEROSCLEROSIS; ATHLETE'S HEART; CMR; ENDURANCE TRAINING; SPORTS","Aorta; Aorta, Thoracic; Calcinosis; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; Sports; aorta; calcinosis; diagnostic imaging; human; male; retrospective study; sport; thoracic aorta","","","","","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and Fondos Feder, (PI18/00139); World Cancer Research Fund International, WCRF, (IIG_FULL_2021_007); World Cancer Research Fund International, WCRF; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII, (CD21/00138); Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII; Wereld Kanker Onderzoek Fonds, WKOF","Research by P.L.V. is supported by a Sara Borrell postdoctoral contract granted by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (CD21/00138).

This encompasses both virtual reality-based system and indoor conventional training. Another objective is to identify user’s acceptance from the use of vProCycle; which acts as the primary instrument of this study. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is a computer-generated simulation experience where immersive surroundings replicate lifelike environments – and is used for cyclists’ physical training. Distinctive combinations of stimulus effectors (such as altitude, wind-effect, visuals, audio etcetera) have been applied to simulate actual world training environment. This is in order to increase the fidelity of presence for the participants involved, with emphasis on the five human senses. However, in this research the focus is only on hearing, sight, and interaction. The methodology of this mixed-mode pilot study is inclusive of 2 cyclists as participants and a 30 minute training session inside the hypoxic chamber room, whereby they have experienced a VR visual route replica of L'Étape du Tour, France. Variables composed of distinctive stimulus effectors are employed during the training, and survey interviews are utilized to gain users’ insight. Results from this pilot study on the presence level indicate that the cyclists’ have given high scores. This high score means that the cyclists were immersed while using the vProCycle system. In addition, the cyclists’ also gave a high score on the level of technology acceptance towards using vProCycle. The main contribution from this study is to understand how various combinations of stimulus effectors can be applied in a VR-based training system. © 2022.

This paper studies a two-echelon vehicle routing problem, one of the most employed models, with a heterogeneous fleet between echelons. Vehicles in the first echelon are mobile satellites that supply the vehicles in the second echelon. Our study aims to minimize the travel time. To solve this complex problem when facing real-life distribution, a heuristic solution approach is followed by decomposing the components of the problem and applying the well-known nearest neighbor procedure. This approach is also justified by the very large amount of delivery points, so the problem dataset can be computationally tractable. Experiments are run using real data from a delivery company in Paris, France. Different scenarios are evaluated, and results show that the consideration of cargo bikes has big potential to reduce some of the externalities caused by conventional delivery systems, while some non-intuitive impacts are also found, such as the increase in land use. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Cargo Bikes; Retail; Supply Chain Management; Sustainability; Two-Echelon Distribution; Urban Logistics","Fleet operations; Sales; Travel time; Vehicle routing; Cargo bike; Chain management; Heterogeneous fleet; Retail; Retail supply chain; Two-echela distribution; Urban delivery; Urban distribution; Urban logistics; Vehicle Routing Problems; Bicycles","","","","","Universidad de La Sabana; Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia and Kedge Business School, (INGPHD-52-2022, INGPHD-10-2019)","The work of the first author was carried out under a post-graduate scholarship awarded by Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia and Kedge Business School, France.

A few studies have sought to study this phenomenon but mainly on the basis of social psychology theories. Based on 84 semi-structured biographical interviews conducted in France, this article aims to discuss their findings using gender, mobility and socialization sociology. We first show how a ‘feminine’ socialization to risk taking, body aesthetics, sport, street and mechanics is an obstacle to cycling during adolescence, especially in the working-class environment and all the more so in spatial contexts with strong norms of male appropriation of public space. We then show how the fact of having cyclists in one's social environment and a sporting inclination plays an important role in limiting the risk of abandonment. By highlighting processes of reinforcement of gendered bodily and spatial inclinations, our results shed light on the links between the socio-construction of inequalities in accessing public space and of inequalities in accessing physical activities.

This paper presents the usefulness of using extrinsic fantasy and a commonplace real bike to address a wide audience. It depicts the interactive universe in which the player pedals a bike equipped with sensors to control the flight altitude of an imaginary character. During a ‘Tour de France 2019' stage, one hundred and seventy-eight fan park visitors - from youths to retirees - tested the exergame. Data were collected from an online questionnaire composed of SUS questionnaire items and from a digital tracking system attached to the game-engine in order to assess the usability, the learnability and the acceptability of the system. Analysis shows that using extrinsic fantasy makes exercising fun and it engages people of all ages regardless of their interest in video games or sports. © 2020, Serious Games Society.

In addition, in urban areas, other negative externalities must be considered, such as congestion, noise, etc. Freight transport is responsible for a significant part of these externalities which companies are not, today, financially charged. To address these issues, one solution is to operate the city in a more sustainable way. In this study, we compare the social cost (cost of ownership and environmental cost) of three technologies (Light Commercial Trucks - LCTs, electric LCTs and cargo bikes) in the case of Paris City. The main results indicate that it is worthwhile to use cargo bikes up to a certain point, the optimum being a mixed fleet. The originality of this study is that it is based on an operational database of one carrier's activities during two months in the Ile-de-France region. © 2023 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.

Methods We used a retrospective cohort study design, where cases were former finishers of ≥1 Grand Tour (Tour de France, Giro d' Italia or Vuelta a España) and controls were untrained individuals free of cardiovascular risk. All participants underwent cardiac magnetic resonance and cardiac computer tomography in the same center during years 2020-2021 to detect myocardial fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement) and to quantify coronary calcium, respectively. Results Twenty-three cases (age, 46 ± 6 yr) and 59 controls (47 ± 7 yr) were studied. Fibrotic patches were evidenced only in the left ventricle, with a higher prevalence in cases (23% vs 2% in controls, P = 0.006). However, fibrotic tissue was nonischemic and of low extension (0.6% ± 0.4% of left ventricle mass), and no significant differences were found between cases and controls for native T1 or T2 values. No between-group differences were found for coronary calcium indicators, including Agatston or density scores. Subanalyses revealed no differences attending to whether cases were still performing regular SEE (n = 8) or not (n = 15) after professional retirement. Conclusions Although former professional cyclists seemed to show a greater prevalence of myocardial fibrosis, the extension of fibrotic tissue was minimal and no alterations were found in coronary calcification indicators. While keeping in mind the low sample size of the cases' group, our results do not support evidence for major cardiac maladaptations with long-term exposure to SEE, at least in middle-age adults.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","ATHEROSCLEROSIS; ATHLETE'S HEART; CMR; ENDURANCE TRAINING; SPORTS","Adult; Bicycling; Calcium; Cardiomyopathies; Contrast Media; Fibrosis; Gadolinium; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Physical Endurance; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; calcium; contrast medium; gadolinium; adult; cardiac muscle; cardiomyopathy; cycling; diagnostic imaging; endurance; fibrosis; human; male; middle aged; pathology; predictive value; retrospective study","","calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; gadolinium, 7440-54-2; Calcium, ; Contrast Media, ; Gadolinium, ","","","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and Fondos Feder, (PI18/00139); Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII, (CD21/00138); Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII","Research by P.

Although this idea persists, it has been challenged by recent research on early sportswomen. These studies raise the question of the scope of sports history, and indeed the very definition of sports itself. These are usually defined in the social sciences as physical activities that are organized, codified and institutionalized, structured by clubs and federations. While at the beginning of the 20th century these clubs and federations were most often closed to women, this does not mean that women were not practicing sports. Physical activities were gaining increasing popularity among women even before this time, and not only among the upper class. There is evidence of women swimming, cycling, racewalking, and even wrestling or boxing in the United States, Canada and Britain, as well as in France. These practices necessarily developed outside institutions, with women taking them up as individual pastimes. As demand grew, some sought to profit from this, and sports promoters organized the first competitions. Journalists then reported on these events in the press, sometimes with amusement, sometimes with disapproval. Yet the first women walkers, runners, cyclists and other athletes are only now beginning to appear in historical studies. This paper seeks to contribute to the rehabilitation of these sportswomen, who include working-class boxers and wrestlers, all of whom have long been subject to a double exclusion—institutional and historical. It presents the history of the first competitions of sportswomen—professional or amateur—in France at the turn of the century, a first foundation stone in writing a new and more inclusive history of sport. 2023 Castan-Vicente.","feminist studies; France; gender studies; professionalism; sports history; women’s history","","","","","","","","Terret T., Histoire du sport, (2023); Louveau C., Inégalité sur la ligne de départ: femmes, origines sociales et conquête du sport, Clio Histoire femmes et sociétés, 23, pp. 119-143, (2006); Clastres P., Dietschy P., Sport, culture et Société en France: du XIXe Siècle à Nos Jours, (2006); Ann Hall M., Women’s high-wheel bicycle racing in nineteenth-century America: more than salacious entertainment, Sport Hist Rev, 50, 2, pp. 137-158, (2019); Tetart P., Mademoiselle Lisette, Première “Championne” Française: Trajectoire et Débats (1894–1898), Sci Soc Sport, 1, 15, pp. 11-41, (2020); Desgrange H.; Tetart P.; Monjaret A.; L’Auto, 26, (1903); Foucault A.; Trottins…trottant!

In order to analyze changes in press discourse on city cycling in France, we examine a corpus that spans the period from September 2019 to September 2020, i.e., six months before the first lockdown (March 17, 2020) and five months after the end of the month-long lockdown (May 11, 2020). The discourse analysis has been conducted on 578 press articles from five regional newspapers (Rennes, Montpellier, Besançon, Paris, and Lyon) and one national press title (Libération). This entire corpus was analyzed using textometry, a computer-assisted method for analyzing quantitative textual data. This enables us to identify a discursive change. Two elements characterize that change: (i) the balance between actors who “talk” or who “are talked about” in the articles shifts gradually. During this period, cycling organizations appear to be the actors whose position is strengthened in the media discourse; (ii) these actors are strengthened in their traditional mission of lobbying for cycling, but with a focus on new issues (e.g., wearing a face-covering or not for cyclists, calling for the reopening of green public spaces to allow the transit of bicycles, etc.). The first Covid-19 wave appears to have been the accelerator of a wider process that has led cycling organizations to professionalize since the 2000s, to move away from ecologist, anarchist, and anticapitalist discourses and to promote instead the idea of everyday cycling as a tool for improving public health. The Covid-19 crisis has further established cycling organizations as reference actors for bicycle mobility in French cities. © The Author(s) 2024.","Association; Covid-19; Cycling; Discourse; Press; Textometry","","","","","","","","Adam M., Ortar N., Becoming Urban Cyclists: From Socialization to Skills, (2022); Buehler R., Pucher J., Cycling through the COVID-19 pandemic to a more sustainable trans-port future: Evidence from case studies of 14 large bicycle-friendly cities in Europe and North America, Sustainability, 14, 12, (2022); Buhler T., Sustainable mobility in Lyon: Should we hang private car drivers?, Tema.

This study aims at assessing the environmental and economic performance of a decentralized biowaste management system, using the frameworks of life cycle assessment and net present value analysis. Five scenarios are designed to reflect the transition from an energy-centered biowaste management (scenario 1) towards a novel biorefinery system (scenario 2) and its expansion to a decentralized network (scenarios 3, 4, and 5) of small-scale plants treating urban biowaste. The global warming potential of the energy-centered system is 134 kg CO2 eq, while the biorefinery system offers mitigation of the global warming by -4324 kg CO2 eq t−1 biowaste treated. The decentralized network designed to capture 20% of the urban biowaste generated in Lyon Metropolitan (S5) provides environmental (S5a: -1983 kg CO2 eq, S5b: -1992 kg CO2 eq) and economic (S5a: 491€, S5b: 475€) benefits, especially when collection is performed with electric bikes (S5b) and the bio-products substitute resource and energy intensive equivalents in the market. Collection with electric bikes contributes to a low-carbon economy while significantly increases labor costs. The transition towards a bio-based economy can transform biowaste management into novel cascading biorefineries of multiple high-value products. Resilient and optimized system design can support low carbon economies and increase employment while being economically sustainable. © 2021","Anaerobic digestion; Biobased industries; Decentralized biowaste management; Life cycle assessment; Net present value analysis; Solid state fermentation","Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Grand Lyon; Lyons; Anaerobic digestion; Bioconversion; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Environmental management; Fermentation; Global warming; Refining; Wages; carbon dioxide; Bio-based; Biobased industry; Biowastes; Decentralised; Decentralized biowaste management; Decentralized networks; Electric bikes; Energy; Net present value analysis; Solid-state fermentation; anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; decentralization; economic analysis; environmental assessment; environmental economics; fermentation; life cycle analysis; sustainability; waste management; waste treatment; Article; bioenergy; controlled study; decentralization; Denmark; economic aspect; environmental economics; global warming potential; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; urban area; waste management; Life cycle","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4","","","European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation, (689229); Graduate School of Science and Technology at Aarhus University","Funding text 1: This work is part of the DECISIVE project that has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation pro- gram under grant agreement No. 689229 .

However, few studies have investigated their multi-exposure and have taken into account its real complexity in building statistical models (nonlinearity, pseudo replication, autocorrelation, etc.). We propose here to model cyclists' exposure to air and noise pollution simultaneously in Paris (France). Specifically, the purpose of this study is to develop a methodology based on an extensive mobile data collection using low-cost sensors to determine which factors of the urban micro-scale environment contribute to cyclists' multi-exposure and to what extent. To this end, we developed a conceptual framework to define cyclists' multi-exposure and applied it to a multivariate generalized additive model with mixed eects and temporal autocorrelation. The results show that it is possible to reduce cyclists' multi-exposure by adapting the planning and development practices of cycling infrastructure, and that this reduction can be substantial for noise exposure. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Bayesian modelling; Cyclist; Exposure; Multi-exposure; NO2; Noise; Paris; Spatial analysis","France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; Autocorrelation; Noise pollution; Conceptual frameworks; Generalized additive model; Low-cost sensors; Mobile data collections; Multi exposure; Noise exposure; Planning and development; Ventilation rate; atmospheric pollution; modeling; noise pollution; pollution exposure; traffic emission; ventilation; Costs","","","","","AirParif; BruitParif; Canada Research Chair in Environmental Equity, (950-230813); Fond de Recherche Soci?t?; Fonds de Recherche du Québec-Société et Culture, FRQSC","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the Canada Research Chair in Environmental Equity (950-230813) and the Fond de Recherche Société et Culture Québec.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Canada Research Chair in Environmental Equity (950-230813) and the Fond de Recherche Soci?t? et Culture Qu?bec.

The present work deals with the sizing optimization of a charging station for ebike based on particle swarm optimization. It is based on the consumption profile of ebike batteries, solar and wind power, installation, replacement and maintenance costs of components. In a first step, the consumption profile of the ebike batteries is determined using the second order non-linear electrothermal model. Then, the solar and wind data over one year are used to determine the availability of energy at the implementation site of the charging station. Finally, the cost is defined as an objective function, taking into account the constraints on the number of solar photovoltaic panels, the number of wind turbines, the number of storage batteries and the annual charging demand. The context of a charging station to be implemented in the Polytech Annecy campus in France is studied. The results show that the particle swarm optimization allows a cost reduction of around 56.04% compared to a sizing without optimization.  © 2021 IEEE.","charging station; costs; ebike; particle swarm optimization; sizing optimization","Cost reduction; Digital storage; Ecology; Electric bikes; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Wind power; Charging demands; Charging station; Current profile; Electro-thermal model; Maintenance cost; Objective functions; Sizing optimization; Solar photovoltaic panels; Charging (batteries)","","","","","","","Muetze A., Tan Y., Performance evaluation of electric bicycles, Fourtieth Ias Annual Meeting.

A consequence of marine living, especially in colder waters, has been a 1.4-2.9-fold increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) for otters, pinnipeds, and cetaceans over predicted levels for terrestrial mammals of similar body mass. Notably, the greatest metabolic elevation occurred in the smallest marine mammals, suggesting an underlying thermal causative mechanism. Superimposed on these resting costs are the metabolic demands of locomotion. Collectively termed the field metabolic rate (FMR), such active costs consistently approach three times the resting rates of individuals regardless of locomotor style, species, foraging patterns, habitat, or geographic location. In wild non-reproducing mammals, the FMR/RMR ratio averages 2.6-2.8 for both terrestrial and marine species, with the latter group maintaining larger absolute daily metabolic rates supported by comparatively higher food ingestion rates. Interestingly, the limit for habitual (multi-day), sustained maximal energy expenditure in human endurance athletes averages <3.0 times resting metabolic levels, with a notable exception in Tour de France cyclists. Importantly, both athletes and wild mammals seem similarly constrained; that is, by the ability to process enough calories in a day to support exceptional metabolic performance.  © 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","","","Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-17-1-2737, N00014-20- 1-2762)","This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research [grant number N00014-17-1-2737, N00014-20- 1-2762] to T.M.W.","Ballesteros FJ, Martinez VJ, Luque B, Lacasa L, Valor E, Moya A., On the thermodynamic origin of metabolic scaling, Sci Rep, 8, pp. 1-10, (2018); Berta A, Sumich JL, Kovaks KM., Marine mammals: evolutionary biology, (2005); Brooks GA, Fahey TD, Baldwin K., Exercise physiology: human bioenergetics and its applications, (2005); Costa DP, Kooyman GL., Contribution of specific dynamic action to heat balance and thermoregulation in the sea otter, Enhydra lutris, Physiol Zool, 57, pp. 199-203, (1984); Dassis M, Rodriguez DH, Leno EN, Davis RW., Submerged swimming and resting metabolic rates in Southern sea lions, J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 432, pp. 106-112, (2012); Davis RW, Williams TM, Kooyman GL., Swimming metabolism of yearling and adult harbor seals Phoca vitulina, Physiol Zool, 58, pp. 590-596, (1985); Davis RW, Williams TM, Thomas JA, Kastelein RA, Cornell LH., The effects of oil contamination and cleaning in sea otters II: metabolism, thermoregulation, and behavior, Canadian J Zool, 66, pp. 2782-2790, (1988); Davis RW., Marine mammals: adaptations for an aquatic life, (2019); Dawson TJ, Fanning FD., Thermal and energetic problems of semiaquatic mammals: a study of the Australian water rat, including comparisons with the platypus, Physiol Zool, 54, pp. 285-296, (1981); Denny MW., Air and water: the biology and physics of life's media, (1993); Dlugosz EM, Chappell MA, Meek TH, Szafranska PA, Zub K, Konarzewski M, Jones JH, Bicudo JEP, Nespolo RF, Careau V, Garland T, Phylogenetic analysis of mammalian maximal oxygen consumption during exercise, J Exp Biol, 216, pp. 4712-4721, (2013); Eastman JT, Coalson RE., The digestive system of the Weddell seal Leptonychotes weddelli: a review, Functional anatomy of marine mammals, pp. 253-320, (1974); Fedak MA, Anderson SA., The energetics of lactation: accurate measurements from a large, wild mammal, the Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), J Zool, 198, pp. 473-479, (1982); Gillooly JF, Gomez JP, Mavrodiev EV., A broad-scale comparison of aerobic activity levels in vertebrates: endotherms versus ectotherms, Proc Roy Soc Lond B, 284, (2017); Goldbogen JA, Cade DE, Wisniewska DM, Potvin J, Segre PS, Savoca MS, Hazen EL, Czapanskiy MF, Kahane-Rapport SR, DeRuiter SL, Gero S., Why whales are big but not bigger: physiological drivers and ecological limits in the age of ocean giants, Science, 366, pp. 1367-1372, (2019); Goldbogen JA, Calambokidis J, Croll DA, Harvey JT, Newton KM, Oleson EM, Schorr G, Shadwick RE., Foraging behavior of humpback whales: kinematic and respiratory patterns suggest a high cost for a lunge, J Exp Biol, 211, pp. 3712-3719, (2008); John J., Energetics of Rest and Locomotion in Diving Mammals: Novel metrics for predicting the vulnerability of threatened cetacean, pinniped and sirenian species, (2020); King JE., Seals of the world.

We also described participant-reported motivations for modal choice for each journey purpose. The study used multilevel models to investigate cross-sectional associations of individual (i.e. age, gender, educational level) and contextual (defined by a combination of residential neighbourhood characteristics in typologies) characteristics with the choice of active and public transport as outcome. Based on an online survey of 6037 residents of Ghent and suburbs (Belgium), Paris and inner suburbs (France), Budapest and suburbs (Hungary), the Randstad (including the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht in the Netherlands) and Greater London (United Kingdom), we observed associations with both individual and contextual characteristics. Results of the multilevel modelling show that the probability of using active or public transport as main mode varies depending on both individual and contextual characteristics. At individual level, relations with gender, age, education, weight status and having at least one child varied according to main transport mode and/or purpose. For example, overweight participants reported lower level of cycling for commuting and non-commuting travels than normal-weight participants. In the context of non-commuting travels, participants with one or more child reported less public transport use and more walking (vs participants without children). Among contextual-level variables, urban characteristics of the residential neighbourhood defined by four clusters (according to food environment, recreational facilities and active mobility opportunities) were associated with public transport and walking but not with cycling. For active transport the most important reasons were “I like to travel (on foot or by bike)” and “I want to be physically active” for both travel purposes. “Public transport facilities nearby” was indicated as the most important reason for public transport (for both trip purposes) – the second was “Journey time”. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring a combination of multiple correlates at individual and contextual level according to journey purposes and suggest that the role of health-related individual characteristics such as weight status need further exploration. © 2021","European metropolitan areas; Modal choice; Motivations; Multilevel approach; Travel purposes","Amsterdam [North Holland]; Belgium; Budapest; East Flanders; England; France; Ghent; Hungary; Ile de France; London [England]; Netherlands; North Holland; Paris; Randstad; Rotterdam; South Holland; The Hague; United Kingdom; Utrecht [Netherlands]; Utrecht [Utrecht (PRV)]; Ville de Paris; commuting; correlation; cycle transport; metropolitan area; public transport; urban region; urban transport; walking","","","","","FP7-HEALTH-2011-two-stage; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (278186); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Cordis","This work is part of the SPOTLIGHT project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme (CORDIS FP7) of the European Commission , HEALTH (FP7-HEALTH-2011-two-stage), Grant agreement No. 278186 .

We surveyed and interviewed precarious workers in France during the COVID-19 crisis, in March and April 2020. We oversampled gig economy workers, in particular in driving and food delivery occupations (hereafter drivers and bikers), residing in metropolitan areas. These workers cannot rely on stable incomes and are excluded from the labor protections offered to employees, features which have been exacerbated by the crisis. We analyzed outcomes for precarious workers during the mandatory lockdown in France as an extreme case to better understand how financial precarity relates to health risks and mental well-being. Our analysis revealed that 3 weeks into the lockdown, 56% of our overall sample had stopped working and respondents had experienced a 28% income drop on average. Gig economy drivers reported a significant 20 percentage point larger income decrease than other workers in our sample. Bikers were significantly more likely to have continued working outside the home during the lockdown. Yet our quantitative analysis also revealed that stress and anxiety levels were not higher for these groups and that bikers in fact reported significantly lower stress levels during the lockdown. While this positive association between being a biker and mental health may be interpreted in different ways, our qualitative data led to a nuanced understanding of the effect of gig work on mental well-being in this population group. © 2020, The New York Academy of Medicine.","COVID-19; Financial precarity; Gig economy; Health and well-being","Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Employment; Female; France; Humans; Income; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; employment; epidemiology; female; France; human; income; job stress; male; mental health; middle aged; pandemic; psychology; risk factor; young adult","","","","","Claire Bouteleux","Respondi carried out the survey.

Few studies have yet been carried out on the effect of modes of transport, times of day or travel locations on the exposure of individuals to PM. We conducted an experiment in Grenoble, France, in spring 2022 to study factors determining the individual exposure to PM. Using low-cost sensors (LCS), PM1 (PM < 1 μm) and PM2.5 (PM < 2.5 μm) levels were measured in four transport modes (bike, walk, bus, and tramway), across four different streets and at three different times of the day. Findings are: (i) - the mode of transport plays a more important role on levels of PMratios (PM concentration ratio to reference) than the time of the day or the location, (ii) - PMratios and inhalation doses are higher in active modes of transport (bike, walk) than in passive ones (bus, tram), (iii) – levels of exposure to PM are ranked as: tram < bus < walk < bike, and (iv) – a statistical model has been developed to predict PMratios as a function of transport mode, travel period, street ratio, and traffic. Exposures to PM in trams are found 12%–25% and 13%–20% lower than in passive modes of transport for PM1 and PM2.5, respectively. Wearing LCSs makes it possible to estimate commuters' exposure to PM and their use should be encouraged for prevention purposes. © 2024 The Authors","Low-cost sensors; Mobility; Particulate matter; Urban microenvironments","Bus transportation; Buses; Light rail transit; Particles (particulate matter); Rail motor cars; Subway cars; Travel time; Trolley cars; Chronic disease; Grenoble; Low-cost sensors; Microenvironments; Mobility; Mode of transport; Particulate Matter; Transport modes; Urban areas; Urban microenvironment; Bicycles","","","","","Ministry of Education and Research of France; Ecole Doctorale Ingénierie pour la Santé, la Cognition et l'Environnement; Université Grenoble Alpes, UGA; Carole Rolland","Marie-Laure Aix is a PhD student supported by a grant from the Ministry of Education and Research of France through the Ecole Doctorale Ing\u00E9nierie pour la Sant\u00E9, la Cognition et l'Environnement (ED-ISCE) of Grenoble Alpes University.

Following the golden age of winter sports, the challenge of sustaining the French ski resort economy in the 1980s was affected by a diversification of practices. Embodying this “fun” attitude, all-terrain cycling spread into the mountains. The representations and the values underlying it allow us to understand the appropriation of these new forms of practices as much as their co-transformations. The case of Oisans, a territory with mythical status thanks to the historical passage of the Tour de France, allows us to put the impact of these new methods into perspective. The events, the shaping of the territory, the professional transformations which are seeds of a sociocultural mutation, and the conflicts linked to integrating the practice determine the impact of this activity, which has now become an identity marker of mountain regions. © 2020, © 2020 Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières.","Alpes; identity; mountain bike; representation; territory","","","","","","LABEX ITEM, (ANR-10-LABX-50-01); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","This work was supported by the LABEX ITEM [ANR-10-LABX-50-01] within the program “Investissements d’Avenir” managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

This object has been referred to as “chest fairing”. The most excessive examples occurred in triathlon, where large objects such as drink bottles were used as chest fairing. More exceptionally, smaller examples have been observed in road cycling in individual time trials (ITT), including the 2023 Tour de France ITT and the 2023 Glasgow Road World Championships ITT. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first published scientific assessment of the benefits that can be obtained by different types of chest fairings. The assessment is performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations validated with wind tunnel tests. A reference configuration of cyclist without chest fairing and seven chest fairing configurations are analysed. The resulting drag reduction can go up to 3.6%, but some chest fairings actually increase the drag. It is concluded that a chest fairing can be beneficial and potentially decisive but that careful and dedicated a priori wind tunnel tests or CFD simulations for the specific rider must be undertaken. © 2024 The Authors","","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Roads and streets; Wind stress; Wind tunnels; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Cycling competition; Fluid dynamic analysis; Fluid-dynamic analysis; Test fluids; Wind tunnel tests; Aerodynamic drag","","","","","CFD","The most thorough and most accurate validation study in this paper was the first one, presented in section 2 (CFD validation \u2013 part I). Here, an attempt was made to reproduce the absolute value of the drag area obtained in the wind tunnel, by CFD. With a minimum deviation of 1.3%, this validation exercise was considered successful. Given the fact that the WT test section was reproduced including the elevated platform and its support beams, as well as the entrance section, one could argue that 1% could be a good indication of the realistic accuracy that detailed CFD simulations can obtain in reproducing the absolute values of drag or drag area carefully measured in a WT. In the present study, this remaining 1.3% deviation was mainly attributed to three reasons: (1) the simplified subtraction of the drag area of the wheel supports from the drag area of the total cyclist-bicycle-support system in the WT, neglecting interference drag; (2) the simplified modelling of surface roughness in CFD by an equivalent sandgrain roughness height; and (3) the inherent simplifications of 3D steady RANS and the turbulence modelling. While the first issue could be resolved by a more slender and elegant wheel support in the WT or by integrating the support in the CFD simulations, the second is not that easy to resolve. However, while the most challenging task in CFD validation is trying to reproduce absolute values, it is arguably less difficult to reproduce trends \u2013 as attempted in section 3 (CFD validation \u2013 part II), where it should be considered that these WT measurements were less accurate and the CFD domains did not at all attempt to replicate the WT test section. All the above considered, some care is needed concerning the computed absolute values of the drag areas for CF2, CF3, CF4 and CF7 in this paper. But on the other hand, the trends could be expected to be accurate and indeed are logical, as are those for CF4, CF5 and CF6.","Release 2020 R2, Theory Guide, (2020); Hot water?

In 2017, an international footbridge competition took place. This was followed by the design phase of the building permit, which was issued on 6 May 2021. Simultaneously, project work was carried out on the tender documentation, on the basis of which the contractor, the company SKANSKA, was selected by the contracting authority. These days, design work on implementation documentation and construction preparation work is being started, which we should have by the end of the year. The footbridge should be completed at the end of 2022. The concept of the bridge is a spatial curve winding through the landscape and reacting gas to the height and floor plan requirements of the assignment. The fine spatial curve is constructed as a smooth path based on the dynamics of pedestrians and cyclists. The curve is formed by straight lines and circular vertical and horizontal arcs. A cross section of the U-shaped bridge is extruded along the spatial curve. The bridge is designed from high-quality ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) with a surface corresponding to glossy white marble. The bridge consists of prefabricated segments, which are connected by means of prestressing cables. The UHPC application is a contemporary progressive and innovative architectural and construction solution (several bridges have recently been built, eg in France, Germany and the Netherlands). Ultra-high performance concrete is currently a professional topic and its application gives the opportunity to realize a unique architectural and engineering work. © 2022 IABSE Symposium Prague, 2022: Challenges for Existing and Oncoming Structures - Report.

It is usually preceded by a pre-processing step and followed by image classification. Usually, a large number of features is needed to end up with the desired classification results.

This method was tested on larynx Contact Endoscopy (CE)—Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) image classification to provide more objective information for otolaryngologists regarding the stage of the laryngeal cancer. Methods: The main idea of the proposed methods is to represent an image as a hilly surface, where different paths can be identified between a starting and an ending point. Each of these paths can be thought of as a Tour de France stage profile where a cyclist needs to perform a specific effort to arrive at the finish line. Several paths can be generated in an image where different cyclists produce an average cyclist effort representing important textural characteristics of the image. Energy and power as two Cyclist Effort Features (CyEfF) were extracted using this concept. The performance of the proposed features was evaluated for the classification of 2701 CE-NBI images into benign and malignant lesions using four supervised classifiers and subsequently compared with the performance of 24 Geometrical Features (GF) and 13 Entropy Features (EF). Results: The CyEfF features showed maximum classification accuracy of 0.882 and improved the GF classification accuracy by 3 to 12 percent. Moreover, CyEfF features were ranked as the top 10 features along with some features from GF set in two feature ranking methods. Conclusion: The results prove that CyEfF with only two features can describe the textural characterization of CE-NBI images and can be part of the CAD system in combination with GF for laryngeal cancer diagnosis. © 2021 by the authors.

While public acceptance and the acceptance of potential users have already been intensively researched, this study investigates the acceptance of CACs from the point of view of different road user groups, such as pedestrians, cyclists and riders of powered two-wheelers as so-called vulnerable road users (VRUs), as well as the drivers of conventional cars. The study measures a priori road user acceptance of CACs using an international population survey that was conducted within the framework of the EU Horizon 2020 funded project ‘BRidging gaps for the adoption of Automated VEhicles’ (BRAVE) in the participating EU-countries France, Germany, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden as well as in Australia and the USA. Including 5,827 respondents, the study findings disclose a rather positive acceptance of CACs from the perspective of different road user groups. However, concerns are also apparent. Results from multivariate analyses indicate that the acceptance of CACs differs between road user groups in that VRUs demonstrated lower acceptance than non-automated car drivers. The role of trust in the new vehicle technology also appears to be significant. Consequently, future developments of CACs should also focus on the communication between automated cars and bystanders (e.g. via external human-machine interfaces) to reduce uncertainties and promote trust. © 2021 Bernhard Schrauth, Walter Funk, Sarah Maier, Clemens Kraetsch.","conditionally automated cars; population survey; road user group-specific acceptance; SAE Level 3; trust; vehicle automation technology","Automation; Multivariant analysis; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Automation technology; Conditionally automated car; Population survey; Road user group-specific acceptance; Road users; SAE level 3; Trust; User groups; Vehicle automation technology; Vehicles automations; Roads and streets","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (723021); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","Funding text 1: This paper builds upon data gathered in the research project ‘BRidging gaps for the adoption of Automated VEhicles’ (BRAVE), which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 723021.; Funding text 2: The study bases its findings on a population survey from the research project ‘BRidging gaps for the adoption of Automated VEhicles’ (BRAVE), funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (No. 723021).

We explore what contributed to the development of pop-up infrastructure during COVID-19, and how these interventions were shaped by and affected policy-making processes and actors’ agency. We found that COVID-19 accelerated social and political trends regarding urban mobility. In both cities, authorities used the crisis to push through existing plans. Authorities’ commitment and the existence of ready-to-implement plans proved crucial. The implementation processes constituted a breach from usual procedures. In Geneva, this empowered actors who usually act from the margins. In Lyon, authorities adopted pop-up infrastructure as a way to reduce costs. Our study clarifies the potential of experimentation in a context of crisis for urban climate governance and highlights the democratic implications of such interventions. © 2023 The Author(s).

Methods: Nine male cyclists completed La Vuelta or Tour de France (2018/19). At study entry, airway inflammation was measured via fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function were assessed prior to the first stage (Pre-GT), at the second rest day (Mid-GT) and prior to the final stage of the GT (Late-GT). Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) was assessed at pre and late-GT timepoints. Results: Seven cyclists reported respiratory symptoms during the race (with a prominence of upper airway issues). Symptom severity increased either mid or late-GT for most cyclists. A decline in FEV1 from pre-to-mid GT (− 0.27 ± 0.24 l, − 5.7%) (P = 0.02) and pre-to-late GT (− 0.27 ± 0.13 l, − 5.7%) (P < 0.001) was observed. Similarly, a decline in FVC (− 0.22 ± 0.17 l, − 3.7%) (P = 0.01) and FEF25-75 (− 0.49 ± 0.34 l/s, − 11%) (P = 0.02) was observed pre-to-late GT. Overall, eight (89%) and six (67%) demonstrated a clinically meaningful decline (> 200 ml) in FEV1 and FVC during the GT follow-up, respectively. SNIP remained unchanged pre-to-late GT (n = 5), however, a positive correlation was observed between ΔSNIP and ΔFVC (r = 0.99, P = 0.002). Conclusion: GT competition is associated with a high prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms and a meaningful decline in lung function in professional cyclists. Further research is now required to understand the underpinning physiological mechanisms and determine the impact on overall respiratory health and elite cycling performance and recovery. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Cycling; Elite; Performance; Physiology; Respiratory","Adult; Athletes; Bicycling; Humans; Male; Nitric Oxide; Respiration; nitric oxide; adult; athlete; breathing; cycling; human; male; metabolism; physiology","","nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; Nitric Oxide, ","","","","","Aaron E., Seow K., Johnson B.D., Dempsey J., Oxygen cost of exercise hyperpnea: implications for performance, J Appl Physiol, 72, pp. 1818-1825, (1992); Abbiss C.R., Menaspa P., Villerius V., Martin D.T., Distribution of power output when establishing a breakaway in cycling, Int J Sports Physiol Perform, 8, pp. 452-455, (2013); Babcock M.A., Pegelow D.F., Harms C.A., Dempsey J.A., Effects of respiratory muscle unloading on exercise-induced diaphragm fatigue, J Appl Physiol, 93, pp. 201-206, (2002); Bell P.G., Furber M.J., Van Someren K.A., Anton-Solanas A., Swart J., The physiological profile of a multiple tour de france winning cyclist, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 49, pp. 115-123, (2017); Bogaerts K., Notebaert K., Van Diest I., Devriese S., De Peuter S., Van den Bergh O., Accuracy of respiratory symptom perception in different affective contexts, J Psychosom Res, 58, pp. 537-543, (2005); Bonini M., Et al., Minimal clinically important difference for asthma endpoints: an expert consensus report, Eur Respir Rev, 29, (2020); Bonini M., Lapucci G., Petrelli G., Todaro A., Pamich T., Rasi G., Bonini S., Predictive value of allergy and pulmonary function tests for the diagnosis of asthma in elite athletes, Allergy, 62, pp. 1166-1170, (2007); Bougault V., Odashiro P., Turmel J., Orain M., Laviolette M., Joubert P., Boulet L.P., Changes in airway inflammation and remodelling in swimmers after quitting sport competition, Clin Exp Allergy, 48, pp. 1748-1751, (2018); Dempsey J.A., La Gerche A., Hull J.H., Is the healthy respiratory system built just right, overbuilt or underbuilt to meet the demands imposed by exercise?, J Appl Physiol, (2020); Derchak P.A., Stager J.M., Tanner D.A., Chapman R.F., Expiratory flow limitation confounds ventilatory response during exercise in athletes, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 1873-1879, (2000); Dickinson J.W., Whyte G., McConnell A., Harries M., Impact of changes in the IOC-MC asthma criteria: a British perspective, Thorax, 60, pp. 629-632, (2005); Dickinson J.W., Whyte G.P., McConnell A.K., Harries M.G., Screening elite winter athletes for exercise induced asthma: a comparison of three challenge methods, Br J Sports Med., 40, pp. 179-182, (2006); Dickinson J.W., Whyte G.P., McConnell A.K., Nevill A.M., Harries M.G., Mid-expiratory flow versus FEV1 measurements in the diagnosis of exercise induced asthma in elite athletes, Thorax, 61, pp. 111-114, (2006); Dominelli P.B., Et al., Effects of respiratory muscle work on respiratory and locomotor blood flow during exercise, Exp Physiol, 102, pp. 1535-1547, (2017); Dominelli P.B., Katayama K., Vermeulen T.D., Stuckless T.J.R., Brown C.V., Foster G.E., Sheel A.W., Work of breathing influences muscle sympathetic nerve activity during semi-recumbent cycle exercise, Acta Physiol, 225, (2019); Dweik R.A., Et al., An official ATS clinical practice guideline: interpretation of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FENO) for clinical applications, Am J Respir Crit Care Med., 184, pp. 602-615, (2011); Fernandez-Garcia B., Perez-Landaluce J., Rodriguez-Alonso M., Terrados N., Intensity of exercise during road race pro-cycling competition, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 1002-1006, (2000); Foster G.E., Et al., Pulmonary mechanics and gas exchange during exercise in Kenyan distance runners, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 46, pp. 702-710, (2014); Fullagar H.H.K., Skorski S., Duffield R., Hammes D., Coutts A.J., Meyer T., Sleep and athletic performance: the effects of sleep loss on exercise performance, and physiological and cognitive responses to exercise, Sports Med, 45, pp. 161-186, (2015); Gift A.G., Validation of a vertical visual analogue scale as a measure of clinical dyspnea, Rehabil Nurs, 14, pp. 323-325, (1989); Graham B.L., Et al., Standardization of spirometry 2019 update.

Focusing on cycling in rural areas allows us to question an emerging practice, often considered dangerous and inconvenient, in areas where cycling is more associated with leisure. The choice of a pragmatic approach centered on engagement opens up a nuanced apprehension of the plurality of existing practices and the many ways of ""making do"" with the conditions offered by rural areas, between busy roads and longer distances. These are all based on individual adaptations that modulate the effort required to get around by bike. But engaging in cycling mobility also means subscribing to a certain conception of ""good mobility"", whether this implies ecological, cheap or simply pleasant mobility. It's the balance struck between the effort required and the ""good"" sought that helps to stabilize and perpetuate the practice. © 2023 Universite des Sciences et Technologiques de Lille.

To identify the sociodemographic factors explaining risky cyclists’ behaviors is therefore important. The relationships between some sociodemographic variables (gender, age, parenthood, use of a shared versus a personal bike) and some risky behaviors (helmet use, red-light running, crossing an intersection with a very short time before the next passing vehicle) remain inconsistent or under-investigated in the literature. These relationships were therefore investigated in a French population. Cyclists (N = 2,788) were observed at two traffic signal intersections in the city center of Lille, France. Two cameras per site were used to score each cyclist’s variables (with a minimum of intercoder reliability = 80%). Men (versus women) and young (versus older) cyclists are less likely to wear a helmet and more likely to run red lights. Cyclists with (versus without) a child seat were more likely to wear a helmet, suggesting that parenthood influences risk perception. Shared (versus personal) bike users were found to be significantly less likely to wear a helmet and more likely to run red lights. This highlights the importance of further investigating whether shared bike users are more likely to take different types of risk on the road. Various factors (psychosocial, enforcement, road design) are discussed to explain these findings and prevent risks. The importance of adapting road safety interventions to the sociodemographic characteristics of cyclists is also discussed. © The Author(s) 2024.","age differences; cycling behavior; gender differences; helmet use; red-light running","Accident prevention; Bicycles; Highway planning; Motor transportation; Risk management; Risk perception; Traffic signals; Wear of materials; Age differences; Cycling behavior; Gender-differences; Helmet use; Observational study; Red light; Red-light running; Risk taking; Socio-demographic characteristics; Transportation mode; Roads and streets","","","","","Région Hauts-de-France; UCL-HDF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the \u201CFondation MAIF pour la recherche\u201D and by the \u201CR\u00E9gion Hauts-de-France,\u201D via the UCL-HDF protocol.

Objectives: This study aims to report and analyze HRV responses in a male professional cyclist over a season, including the Tour de France. Methods: A professional cyclist recorded resting and exercise inter-beat intervals during 5 months, comprising a training period with two altitude sojourns and two competition blocks, including the Tour de France. Resting recordings lasted 5 min in the supine position and were used for computation of mean heart rate (HR), root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSDs), and power in the low- and high-frequency bands (LF and HF, respectively). Training load quantification was based on recorded HR during exercise and expressed as training impulses (TRIMPSs). Results: LF (3,319 ± 2,819 vs. 1,097 ± 1,657 ms2), HF (3,590 ± 1858 vs. 1,267 ± 1,683 ms2), and RMSSD (96 ± 26 vs. 46 ± 30 ms) were higher and HR (47 ± 4 vs. 54 ± 2 bpm) was lower during the training period when compared to the two competition blocks. The coefficient of variation (CV) was significantly lower during the training period than during the two competition blocks for RMSSD (26 vs. 72%), LF (85 vs. 160%), and HF (58 vs. 141%). Discussion: The present study confirms that monitoring daily HRV responses during training periods is valuable in professional cycling, but questions its usefulness during the Tour de France. Moreover, the previous suggestion that CV in RMSSD would help to predict poor performance was not confirmed in a professional cyclist.

Both to minimize detrimental performance effects associated with arterial desaturation occurring at moderate altitudes in elite athletes, respectively, reduce the risk of hyperthermia on hot days, but also as a pre-competition acclimatization strategy to boost blood volume in already highly adapted athletes. The hematological adaptations require weeks of exposure to manifest, but are attractive as an augmented hemoglobin mass may improve arterial oxygen delivery and hence benefit prolonged performances. Altitude training camps have in this context a long history in exercise physiology and are still common practice in elite cycling. However, heat-acclimation training provides an attractive alternative for some athletes either as a stand-alone approach or in combination with altitude. The present paper provides an update and practical perspectives on the potential to utilize hypoxia and heat exposure to optimize hematological adaptations. Furthermore, we will consider temporal aspects both in terms of onset and decay of the adaptations relevant for improved thermoregulatory capacity and respiratory adaptations to abate arterial desaturation during altitude exposure. From focus on involved physiological mechanisms, time course, and responsiveness in elite athletes, we will provide guidance based on our experience from practical implementation in cyclists preparing for prolonged stage races such as the Tour de France. © 2022 The Authors.

In this case study, we report for the first time the energetics of a female world-tour cyclist competing in the 2023 Tour de France Femmes, an 8-day race of the Union Cycliste Internationale. The 29-year-old athlete presented with oligomenorrhea and low T3 before the race. Total daily energy expenditure assessed with the doubly labeled water technique was 7,572 kcal/day (∼4.3 physical activity levels), among the highest reported in the literature to date for a female. Crank-based mean maximal power was consistent with female world-tour cyclists (5 min, mean 342W, 4.8 W/kg; 20 min 289W, 4.1 W/kg). The average daily energy intake measured with the remote food photography method (Stage Days 1-7) was 5,246 kcal and carbohydrate intake was 13.7 g/kg (range 9.7-15.9 g/kg), and 84 g/hr during stages, and an average fat intake of 15% of daily energy intake. An estimated 2,326 kcal/day energy deficit was evidenced in a 2.2 kg decrease in body mass. Notwithstanding the high carbohydrate intake, the athlete was unable to match the energy requirements of the competition. Despite signs of energy deficiency preexisting (oligomenorrhea and low T3), and other further developing during the race (weight loss), performance was in line with that of other world-tour cyclists and a best personal performance was recorded for the last stage. This case study emphasizes the need for further research to inform energy requirements for female athletes' optimal performance and health.  © 2024 Human Kinetics, Inc.","doubly labeled water; energy balance;

We aim to assess the mortality and morbidity impacts of cycling in a country with relatively low levels of cycling, France, along with associated monetary benefits. We further assess the potential additional benefits of shifting a portion of short trips from cars to bikes, including projected greenhouse gas emissions savings. Methods: Using individual data from a nationally representative mobility survey, we described the French 2019 cycling levels by age and sex. We conducted a burden of disease analysis to assess the incidence of five chronic diseases (breast cancer, colon cancer, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and type-2 diabetes) and the number of deaths prevented by cycling, based on national incidence and mortality data and dose–response relationships from meta-analyses. We assessed the corresponding direct medical cost savings and the intangible costs prevented based on the value of a statistical life year. Lastly, based on individual simulations, we assessed the likely additional benefits of shifting 25% of short (<5 km) car trips to cycling. Findings: The French adult (20–89 years) population was estimated to cycle on average 1 min 17 sec pers−1 day−1 in 2019, with important heterogeneity across sex and age. This yielded benefits of 1,919 (uncertainty interval, UI: 1,101–2,736) premature deaths and 5,963 (UI: 3,178–8,749) chronic disease cases prevented, with males reaping nearly 75% of these benefits. Direct medical costs prevented were estimated at €191 million (UI: 98–285) annually, while the corresponding intangible costs were nearly 25 times higher (€4.8 billion, UI: 3.0–6.5). We estimated that on average, €1.02 (UI: 0.59–1.62) of intangible costs were prevented for every km cycled. Shifting 25% of short car trips to cycling would yield approximatively a 2-fold increase in deaths prevented, while also generating important CO2 emissions reductions (0.257 MtCO2e, UI: 0.231–0.288). Interpretation: In a country with a low- to moderate-cycling culture, cycling already generates important public health and health-related economic benefits. Further development of active transportation would increase these benefits while also contributing to climate change mitigation targets.

We analyze national aggregate data from automatic bicycle counters for 13 countries in Europe and North America to determine month-by-month and year-to-year changes in cycling levels in 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019. That aggregate analysis is complemented by case studies of 14 cities in the USA, Canada, the UK, Belgium, France, Spain, and Germany. Although there was much variation over time, among countries, and among cities, cycling levels generally increased from 2019 to 2021, mainly due to growth in cycling for recreation and exercise. In contrast, daily trips to work and education declined. All 14 of the cities we examined in the case studies reported large increases in government support of cycling, both in funding as well as in infrastructure. Bikeway networks were expanded and improved, usually with protected cycling facilities that separate cyclists from motorized traffic. Other pro-cycling measures included restrictions on motor vehicles, such as reducing speed limits, excluding through traffic from resi-dential neighborhoods, banning car access to some streets, and re-allocating roadway space to bi-cycles. Car-restrictive measures became politically possible due to the COVID-19 crisis. © 2022 by the authors.

After an individual apostolate (1936/42), he surrounded himself with collaborators to take the wellbeing of professional sportspeople of all disciplines to heart. In 1943, a sort of apostolate council was convened for a meeting; from 1947 onwards, this association was called Sporta. Father Van Clé began to more actively help sportspeople, to defend their rights, and to assist them socially and morally. In 1949, local sections and regional activities were initiated. Van Clé introduced a monthly magazine, drawing attention to the excesses and abuses within the world of sport, such as the commercialisation of the Tour de France. After Van Clé's death in 1955, Sporta was expanded: study and information services, a social service and a fair play club were founded. Through sport camps and youth holidays, Sporta annually reached 15,000 youngsters. Until this very day, Sporta-federatie continues to safeguard the values of the world of sport: promoting fair play, engaging in the fight against drugs, and liberating sports from exaggerated commercialisation. It also defends the legal rights of professional and amateur sportspeople. This contribution draws attention to the figure of this almost forgotten Norbertine, including his original apostolate among the professional sportspeople (cyclists, pugilists and wrestlers) and contextualises this apostolate within the broader attitude of the Catholic Church toward professional sport, to explain why one can consider Van Clé as a key figure of the interconnection between religion, ethics and sport in Belgium. © 2022 by Louvain Studies, all rights reserved.","","","","","","","","","Cauwels Alfred, Een man van gisteren voor morgen, (1982); Claes Dries, Antoon van Clé, stichter en bezieler van Sporta, (2005); Dekkers Wilfried, Pater Antoon van Clé, (1998); Clé, Cornelius Josephus Alphonsus, Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek, 7, pp. 148-155, (1977); Vanysacker Dries, Van Clé (Cornelius Josephus, Religious Name Antoon), Belgian Norbertine, Founder of Sporta vzw (1891-1955), Dictionnaire d'histoire et de géographie ecclésiastiques, 32, 191, pp. 1483-1488, (2019); Vanysacker Dries,  eeuw - heden): Een moeilijk evenwicht, pp. 145-152, (2021); Ons wekelijksch praatje… met Z.E.

Across a variety of sports, these individuals have trained to optimize the physiological parameters of their bodies in order to compete on the world stage. To characterize endurance capacity, techniques such as heart rate monitoring, indirect calorimetry, and whole blood lactate measurement have provided insight into oxygen utilization, and substrate utilization and preference, as well as total metabolic capacity. However, while these techniques enable the measurement of individual, representative variables critical for sports performance, they lack the molecular resolution that is needed to understand which metabolic adaptations are necessary to influence these metrics. Recent advancements in mass spectrometry-based analytical approaches have enabled the measurement of hundreds to thousands of metabolites in a single analysis. Here we employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to investigate whole blood responses to exercise in elite World Tour (including Tour de France) professional cyclists before and after a graded maximal physiological test. As cyclists within this group demonstrated varying blood lactate accumulation as a function of power output, which is an indicator of performance, we compared metabolic profiles with respect to lactate production to identify adaptations associated with physiological performance. We report that numerous metabolic adaptations occur within this physically elite population (n = 21 males, 28.2 ± 4.7 years old) in association with the rate of lactate accumulation during cycling. Correlation of metabolite values with lactate accumulation has revealed metabolic adaptations that occur in conjunction with improved endurance capacity. In this population, cycling induced increases in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and Coenzyme A precursors. These responses occurred proportionally to lactate accumulation, suggesting a link between enhanced mitochondrial networks and the ability to sustain higher workloads. In association with lactate accumulation, altered levels of amino acids before and after exercise point to adaptations that confer unique substrate preference for energy production or to promote more rapid recovery. Cyclists with slower lactate accumulation also have higher levels of basal oxidative stress markers, suggesting long term physiological adaptations in these individuals that support their premier competitive status in worldwide competitions. © Copyright © 2020 San-Millán, Stefanoni, Martinez, Hansen, D’Alessandro and Nemkov.","amino acid metabolism; elite athletes; endurance; exercise; lactate; metabolomics; mitochondrial metabolism; oxidative stress","amino acid; coenzyme A; lactic acid; tricarboxylic acid; accident prevention; adaptation; adult; Article; blood sampling; controlled study; correlational study; cycling; cyclist; endurance; energy yield; exercise; human; lactate blood level; male; metabolomics; nutrition; oxidative stress; rehabilitation care; training","","amino acid, 65072-01-7; coenzyme A, 85-61-0; lactic acid, 113-21-3, 50-21-5","","","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (R01HL146442, R01HL148151, R01HL149714, R21HL150032, T32 HL007171)","Funding.

Methods: Our retrospective observational study relied on the register of road accident victims of 2019 that includes all victims of road accidents admitted in public or private hospital emergency departments of the Rhône administrative county (France). We studied characteristics of scooter accidents, of victims and of their injuries. We used the abbreviated injury scale (AIS 2005) to describe injuries, and the maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS) to define the most severe injury for multi-traumatized victims. Results: In 2019, 1,197 scooter-related victims were identified, and 90% (N = 946) occurred in the hyper-urban center. The total number of accidents related to scooters increased by 7.3% compared to before the introduction of electric scooters for rent. Nearly 77% (N = 920) of the accidents involved the rider only. Only 6% (N = 72) of the injured riders were wearing a helmet at the time of the injury. Most of the injured people (73%) were in the 10-34 years range (N = 869), and a quarter of injured riders (25%) were aged 20-24 years (N = 301). Riders experienced two injuries on average. Severe injuries (MAIS ≥ 3) represented 3.8% of injuries and there was no statistically significant difference between electric and human powered scooters (P = 0.2). The rate of head injuries was higher in injured scooter riders compared with injured cyclists, whose accident characteristics can be considered as very similar (37 vs. 27%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The sharp increase of injured scooter riders, and the extent of injuries that affect the skull and the face calls for new safety recommendations about protective gear and riding regulations.  © SFMU et Lavoisier SAS 2021.","Abbreviated Injury Scale; E-scooter; Emergency department; Standing electric scooter; Traumatology","","","","","","","","Gennarelli TA, Wodzin E, The Abbreviated Injury Scale 2005, (2005); Nikan KN, Hansen L, Thomas T, Et al., Electric scooter injuries and hospital admissions in the United States, 2014-2018, JAMA Surg, 155, pp. 357-359, (2020); Bresler AY, Hanba C, Svider P, Et al., Craniofacial injuries related to motorized scooter use: a rising epidemic, Am J Otolaryngol, 40, pp. 662-666, (2019); Nellamattathil M, Amber I, An evaluation of scooter injury and injury patterns following widespread adoption of E-scooters in a major metropolitan area, Clinimag, 60, pp. 200-203, (2020); Trivedi B, Kesterke MJ, Bhattacharjee R, Et al., Craniofacial injuries seen with the introduction of bicycle-share electric scooters in an urban setting, J Oral Maxillofac Surg, 77, pp. 2292-2297, (2019); Trivedi TK, Liu C, Antonio AL, Et al., Injuries associated with standing electric scooter use, JAMA Netw Open, 2, (2019); Behkit MNZ, Le Fevre J, Bergin CJ, Regional healthcare costs and burden of injury associated with electric scooter, Injury, 51, pp. 271-277, (2020)","","","Lavoisier","","","","","","21086524","","","","French","Ann.

With this study we aim at assessing and comparing personal exposure to traffic-related air pollution and related estimated inhaled dose of different typical commuter profiles in real-world scenarios focusing on multimodal commuting and different transport microenvironments. A car driver and two multimodal commuters (cyclist/public transport and pedestrian/public transport commuters), which reached the same destination in the city center, leaving from the same starting point in the metropolitan area of the city, were investigated in the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy. Real-time monitors for the measurement of size-fractionated particulate matter (PM - Aerocet 831-Met One Instrument Inc., Grant Pass, Oregon, USA), equivalent Black Carbon (eBC - Aethlabs, San Francisco, CA, USA), and NO2 (CairClip NO2, Cairpol; La Roche Blanche, France) and time-integrated samplers for the measurement of NO2 and benzene were used. Inhaled dose was estimated as well by applying estimated pulmonary ventilation rates to 1-min exposure measures. The Bootstrapping method was used to resample data and perform more robust comparisons among commuters and microenvironments (MEs). Results of the study could be summarized as follows: (i) travel times of the cyclist were the shortest; (ii) the highest concentrations and estimated inhaled doses were found during morning rush hour; (iii) the cyclist and the car commuter were exposed to the highest overall median values of fractionated PM and benzene, respectively; (iv) cycling MEs presented the highest median concentrations of PM, while the overall median concentration of eBC was higher commuting by car than walking and cycling; (v) the cyclist was the commuter with the highest overall median estimated inhaled dose for fractionated PM, while benzene was the highest for the car driver, and NO2 for the pedestrian; (vi) exposure differences both among microenvironments and commuters diverged comparing morning and evening commuting. Our results suggest that a multi-pollutant approach is necessary to better represent the complexity of personal exposure to traffic-related air pollution in multimodal mobility studies. Moreover, shifting from car driving to multimodal mobility is already a valuable choice for the metropolitan area of Milan considering both exposure and commuting time. However, to further reduce personal exposure and especially estimated inhaled dose of multimodal and active commuters, exposure mitigation interventions in selected MEs, traffic calming, and innovative mobility policies are still needed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Inhalation dose; Microenvironment; Personal exposure; Time-activity pattern; Traffic related air pollution (TRAP); Travel mode","Varanidae; Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Travel time; benzene; black carbon; chloride; diesel fuel; gasoline; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur; Inhalation dose; Metropolitan area; Microenvironments; Multi-modal; NO $-2$; Personal exposures; Public transport; Time activity patterns; Traffic related air pollution; Travel modes; atmospheric pollution; commuting; metropolitan area; mobility; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution exposure; walking; air pollutant; air pollution; air temperature; Article; bootstrapping; car; car driver; car driving; controlled study; cycling; cyclist; gravimetry; human; human experiment; limit of detection; lung ventilation; meteorology; microenvironment; normal human; particle size; particulate matter; pedestrian; PM2.5 exposure; traffic and transport; walking; Benzene","","benzene, 71-43-2; chloride, 16887-00-6; diesel fuel, 68334-30-5; gasoline, 86290-81-5; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9","","","Università degli Studi dell'Insubria","Altroconsumo Associazione, thanks to the project “Senti che aria”, funded by Lombardia Region, provided resources for this research to the Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health of the University of Milan and to the Department of Science and High Technology of the University of Insubria .

Grenoble Alpes, SENS, Grenoble, 38000, France","Background: Frequent car use contributes to health and environmental issues such as air pollution, climate change and obesity. Active and sustainable mobility (bike, walk, public transport, car sharing) may address these issues. Different strategies have been implemented in past research, involving hard levers, aimed at modifying the economical or geographical context (e.g., free public transport), and soft levers, aimed at modifying psychological processes (e.g., personalised transport advice). However, few studies have combined both hard and soft levers. In addition, few have used robust methodologies (e.g., randomised controlled trials), followed behavioural changes in the long-term, and been anchored in behaviour change theories. InterMob aims to address these limits by implementing a 24-month randomised controlled trial including hard and soft levers. The objectives of InterMob are to a) evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental arm versus an active controlled arm, and b) identify the processes of mobility change. Methods: Regular car users living in Grenoble (N = 300) will be recruited and randomised to one of the two arms. The experimental arm consists in a six-month intervention combining hard levers (free access to transport/bikes), and soft levers (e.g., personalised transport advice). The control arm consists in a six-month intervention aimed at raising awareness on air pollution and its health effects. Both arms will include eight evaluation weeks (spread out over 24 months) based on a GPS, an accelerometer, and a pollution sensor. Moreover, participants will complete mobility logbooks and surveys measuring psychological constructs, socio-economical, and socio-spatial characteristics. Discussion: InterMob will assess the effectiveness of two interventions aimed at reducing car use within regular car users in the short-, mid- and long-term. Moreover, InterMob will allow to better understand the psychological processes of behaviour change, and the socio-economical and geographical conditions under which the intervention is efficient in reducing car use. Finally, the benefits of mobility change in terms of physical activity, quality of life, and exposure to pollution will be quantified.

The Franco regime (1939–75) set this nationalising process as one of its main goals, in order to legitimise itself. In many senses this project failed, and many national symbols ended up with negative associations. This article argues that there was one successful example of promotion of that identity: the use of sports. The national press participated in this process by pushing the ideal of the Spanish quixotic hero, personified by several athletes in individual sports, including cyclist Federico Martín Bahamontes, the first Spanish winner of the Tour de France in 1959. Sports figures like Bahamontes represented this ideal through five main characteristics: idealism to succeed despite humble origins, moral values, perseverance in the face of adversity, irrational and impractical decisions, and heroism for the nation. All these characteristics are studied here through the words of newspapers from the time. The names of these athletes are still invoked today as pioneering examples of great Spaniards, which proves that this aspect of national identity was successful in becoming part of the Spanish collective identity. © 2021 The British Society of Sports History.","cycling; identity; nationalism; Spain; sport","","","","","","Universidad Nacional de Ingenierias, UNI","This work was supported by a UNI Graduate College 2017 Summer Fellowship.

Mobility and crowdsensing have emerged as a new means to investigate the ambient air quality in urban areas. However, the design of the network (e.g., number of sensors per unit area) and the scientific interpretation of collected data with an ad hoc method are still challenging. In this paper, we focus on the use of a fleet of private bicycles to monitor NO2 concentrations in the city of Marseille, France. The study is based on synthetic observations generated by means of a regional air quality simulation system at a spatial resolution of 25 m x 25 m and simulated bike trips that are randomly generated in the city. The bike trips correspond to a maximum of 4500 bike commuters and are generated using a web-based navigation service. Simulated bike tracks are validated using available statistics on bike counts. Each bike track is associated with the along-track corresponding NO2 concentrations collected from the air quality simulations and physical features on the ground collected from Open Street Map. Spatialization of the information collected aboard the bikes is tested by using three different algorithms: kriging, land-use regression (LUR) and neural network (NN). LUR and NN show that the fleet can be limited to below 100 bikes while the performance of kriging is steadily increasing with the number of bikes. Increasing the sample distance above 200 m also impairs the citywide prediction of simulated NO2 concentrations. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; Mobility; NO<sub>2</sub>; Regression model; Urban-scale","Bouches du Rhone; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Air quality; Interpolation; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Sporting goods; Air quality monitoring; Air quality simulation; Ambient air quality; Land use regression; Navigation service; Neural network (nn); Regional air quality; Spatial resolution; air quality; ambient air; comparative study; computer simulation; concentration (composition); element mobility; kriging; nitrogen dioxide; numerical model; pollution monitoring; sensor; urban area; urban atmosphere; Bicycles","","","","","","","Evolution of WHO Air Quality Guidelines Past, Present and Future, (2017); Marjovi A., Arfire A., Mattinoli A., High Resolution Air Pollution Maps in Urban Environments Using Mobile Sensor Networks, Proceedings of the International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems, (2015); Thunis P., Miranda A., Baldasano J.M., Blond N., Douros J., Graff A., Janssen S., Juda-Rezler K., Karvosenoja N., Maffeis G., Et al., Overview of Current Regional and Local Scale Air Quality Modelling Practices: Assessment and Planning Tools in the EU, Environ.

Level crossing accidents represent 24% of all significant railway accidents when railway suicides are excluded according to the European Union Agency for Railways statistics. There is a complex interaction among the components that makes this kind of intersection dangerous, depending on the road users' behaviour, the unsafe layout of the infrastructure and the response of the various type of users with regard to the different conditions (traffic, weather, design, etc.). Starting from these considerations, the SAFER-LC Project has the objective of upgrading safety and minimising risks at and around level crossings by developing a fully integrated cross-modal set of innovative solutions and tools for the proactive management and new design of level-crossing infrastructure. This paper presents the results of the first phase of this project with special attention about the results of the Italian level crossings conditions. With regard to the first phase of the project, the paper proposes a comparative analysis between Italy and seven European countries (Greece, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Spain and Turkey), carrying out an in-depth Level Crossing accident analysis with data and reports from the railway operators and the national accident investigation bodies. The analysis focuses the attention on specific variables such as details on collision, victim, road and railway environment, level crossing characteristics and circumstances. The analysis highlights the existence of some critical issues for safety with important differences in terms of characteristics and intensity in each country and especially for the Italian case. © 2020 The Author(s).","Accident; In-depth Safety Analysis; Level Crossing","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (723205)","","Seehafer W., Verkehrsgerechte Sicherung von Bahnübergängen, pp. 109-134, (1997)","M.

In this problem, e-cargo bikes perform the last-mile delivery. In fact, this transportation mode is positioned as a promising alternative to make last-mile delivery. Studies show cost and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions savings with cargo bikes setup compared to conventional vans. To solve this problem, a three-stage decomposition algorithm is proposed. In the first stage, the non-supervised machine learning clustering method 2D-k-means is considered to cluster the clients to the satellites. The second and third stages comprise the second and first echelon routing. The last two stages use a heuristic based on the Nearest Neighbor (NN) procedure. Two local search operators were used as improvement algorithms for the solution given by the NN in the second stage. There are scarce studies that use the 2D-k-means algorithm in this urban distribution network context. Experiments are run using a small instance based on real data from a delivery company in the city of Paris, France. Results show that the fixed costs and the cost of energy consumption of the e-cargo bikes are cheaper than the van used in the first echelon. Also, a reduction of 8.2% in terms of travel time is obtained when the Relocate local search is applied. Additional savings are achieved in performance indicators. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Last-mile delivery; Routing problems; Smart city; Sustainability; Urban logistics","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Routing algorithms; Supervised learning; Vehicle routing; Clusterings; Last mile; Last-mile delivery; Nearest-neighbour; Optimization algorithms; Parcel delivery; Routing optimization; Routing problems; Urban logistics; Vehicle Routing Problems; Travel time","","","","","","","Bac U., Erdem M., Optimization of electric vehicle recharge schedule and routing problem with time windows and partial recharge: A comparative study for an urban logistics fleet, Sustain Cities Soc, 70, (2021); Cortes J.D., Suzuki Y., Last-mile delivery efficiency: En route transloading in the parcel delivery industry, Int.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the trends of performance, pacing, nationality, sex differences, and rate of non-finishers in ultra-triathlons. Data from 1985 to 2018 were collected including Double Iron, Triple Iron, Quintuple Iron, and Deca Iron ultra-triathlons. Different pacing patterns by event and sex were observed (P <.05); athletes spent less %time in swimming and cycling, and more %time in running as the distance of event was longer; women spent more %time in cycling and less% time in running in Double and Triple. Performance analysis showed a negative trend over time for men and women since 1985. Switzerland, France, and Germany were the fastest nations in ultra-triathlons. The frequency of North Americans competing in Europe was very low (<5%), whereas Europeans often competed in North America (~25%). The rate of non-finishers between sexes was similar in all races with the exception of Deca Iron ultra-triathlon, which was much greater (~20%) for women. Non-finishers had slower race times in swimming and cycling splits than finishers. In conclusion, ultra-triathletes should redistribute their energy among swimming, cycling, and running depending on their sex and distance of race. Performance in ultra-triathlons has been decreasing in men and women over the years, but sex difference in performance remained. Europeans were the fastest ultra-triathletes and compete in Europe and North America. Additionally, non-finishers were slower swimmers and cyclists than finishers. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A low HR and vagally mediated HRV index change between supine and standing positions reflected a maladaptive training stress-recovery status. Objectives: Our study was focused on a female multistage cycling event. Its overall aim was twofold: (1) quantify the correlation between (a) the change in HR and HRV indices during an active orthostatic test and (b) subjective/objective fatigue, physical load, and training level indicators; and (2) formulate a model predicting the stress-recovery status as indexed by (Formula presented.) and ΔLnRMSSD (defined as the difference between standing and supine mean RR intervals and LnRMSSD, respectively), based on subjective/objective fatigue indicators, physical load, and training levels. Methods: Ten female cyclists traveled the route of the 2017 Tour de France, comprising 21 stages of 200 km on average. From 4 days before the beginning of the event itself, and until 1 day after its completion, every morning, each cyclist was subjected to HR and HRV measurements, first at rest in a supine position and then in a standing position. The correlation between HR and HRV indices and subjective/objective fatigue, physical load, and training level indicators was then computed. Finally, several multivariable linear models were tested to analyze the relationships between HR and HRV indices, fatigue, workload, and training level indicators. Results: HR changes appeared as a reliable indicator of stress-recovery status. Fatigue, training level, and (Formula presented.) displayed a linear relationship. Among a large number of linear models tested, the best one to predict stress-recovery status was the following: (Formula presented.) 1,249.37+12.32V̇O2max + 0.36 km⋅week–1−8.83 HRmax−5.8 RPE−28.41 perceived fatigue with an adjusted R2 = 0.322. Conclusion: The proposed model can help to directly assess the adaptation status of an athlete from RR measurements and thus to anticipate a decrease in performance due to fatigue, particularly during a multistage endurance event. © Copyright © 2020 Barrero, Le Cunuder, Carrault, Carré, Schnell and Le Douairon Lahaye.","cycling; endurance; females; heart rate variability; mathematical model; performance; stress-recovery status","adult; Article; cycling; fatigue; female; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; normal human; physiological stress; RR interval; standing; supine position; training","","","","","Johan Cassirame and Armel Cretual","The authors gratefully acknowledge the enthusiastic participation of the subjects in this study and the generous technical support of Johan Cassirame and Armel Cretual.","Akaike H., A new look at the statistical model identification, IEEE Trans.

In large cities, instant on-demand meal delivery has gained tremendous momentum. This activity is mainly taken on by self-employed workers; consequently, they are in charge of providing their own equipment and vehicle, may it be their own or a rented vehicle. The aim of this paper is to explore delivery riders’ mobility practices in Paris. This research relies on quantitative data from a survey conducted in February 2021 on a sample of more than 500 instant meal delivery riders operating in the northeast district of Paris. Data allowed to characterize the mobility of delivery riders in Paris when on the job. Results reveal that 46.4% of them use bicycles and 38.8% of these bicycle riders rely on Paris’ public shared bicycle service, Vélib’. Results suggest that the Paris shared bicycle scheme allows them to access an electric bicycle at a cheap price. This raises several policy questions. First, in the mind of its early promoters, Vélib’ was not designed to serve the needs of professional delivery workers; their use of the service might limit the availability of bicycles for private users, among other operational challenges. Second, Vélib is providing precarious gig workers with a valuable resource to cope with the insecure conditions associated with instant delivery for digital platforms. This work brings new insights in terms of working conditions of delivery cyclists, and points to the need for comprehensive policy interventions at the municipal level. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Bikesharing; Delivery gig workers; Food delivery; Gig economy; Instant delivery; On-demand meal delivery","France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; labor mobility; policy approach; surveying; working conditions","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","Declaration of interest, The authors of this article are part of 6 t's research team and Logistics City Chair of Gustave Eiffel University. 6 t is an independent social sciences research firm specialized in mobility.

Nevertheless, its mechanisms of action are unclear and need to be better characterised according to the stimulated brain area and the type of exercise performed. Methods/design: This is a double-blind crossover study, organised into two parts: the first is to assess the effects of tDCS on explosive performance (jump task) and the second is to assess the effects on endurance performance (cycling time trial task). Participants, who are recreationally active or athletes (parkour practitioners, cyclists), will receive two active tDCS sessions (over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right motor cortex) and one sham tDCS session (part A), or two sequences (one active and one sham) of two daily tDCS sessions over 5 days (part B). Motor and cognitive performance will be compared before and after tDCS sessions (part A), and before and after the first session, after the last session and at day 12 and day 30 of each tDCS sequence (part B). Discussion: This study investigates the acute and repeated effects of tDCS on the motor and cognitive performance of healthy subjects.

The objective of this study was to examine the capacity of male and female professional cyclists to recover between daily race stages while competing in the 2022 Tour de France and the 2022 Tour de France Femmes, respectively. The 17 participating cyclists (8 males from a single team and 9 females from two teams) wore a fitness tracker (WHOOP 4.0) to capture recovery metrics related to night-time sleep and autonomic activity for the entirety of the events and for 7 days of baseline before the events. The primary analyses tested for a main effect of ‘stage classification’—i.e., rest, flat, hilly, mountain or time trial for males and flat, hilly or mountain for females—on the various recovery metrics. Results: During baseline, total sleep time was 7.2 ± 0.3 h for male cyclists (mean ± 95% confidence interval) and 7.7 ± 0.3 h for female cyclists, sleep efficiency was 87.0 ± 4.4% for males and 88.8 ± 2.6% for females, resting HR was 41.8 ± 4.5 beats·min−1 for males and 45.8 ± 4.9 beats·min−1 for females, and heart rate variability during sleep was 108.5 ± 17.0 ms for males and 119.8 ± 26.4 ms for females. During their respective events, total sleep time was 7.2 ± 0.1 h for males and 7.5 ± 0.3 h for females, sleep efficiency was 86.4 ± 1.2% for males and 89.6 ± 1.2% for females, resting HR was 44.5 ± 1.2 beats·min−1 for males and 50.2 ± 2.0 beats·min−1 for females, and heart rate variability during sleep was 99.1 ± 4.2 ms for males and 114.3 ± 11.2 ms for females. For male cyclists, there was a main effect of ‘stage classification’ on recovery, such that heart rate variability during sleep was lowest after mountain stages. For female cyclists, there was a main effect of ‘stage classification’ on recovery, such that the percentage of light sleep (i.e., lower-quality sleep) was highest after mountain stages. Conclusions: Some aspects of recovery were compromised after the most demanding days of racing, i.e., mountain stages. Overall however, the cyclists obtained a reasonable amount of good-quality sleep while competing in these physiologically demanding endurance events. This study demonstrates that it is now feasible to assess recovery in professional athletes during multiple-day endurance events using validated fitness trackers. © The Author(s) 2024.","Athletes; Competition;

Users’ comments were classified in categories as follows: system capabilities, purpose and benefits, travel destination and encouraging remarks. Major results show that participants felt safe, where only 1.01% of comments denoted apprehension despite the increase of speed (up to 50 km/h) with respect to other studies. Users’ were satisfied with the automated vehicle (AV) performance, where only 3.5% criticized the system, denoting they expected a higher level of autonomy. 22% of users mentioned train stations as useful application (i.e. potential destination) for an automated on-demand mobility service. More than 200 comments were related to travel destinations, pointing towards various scenarios where an AV service could be useful for them. Conclusions show that realistic vehicle speed increases passenger acceptance of automated vehicles, increasing system confidence with respect to previous studies in the field. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Automated vehicles; Experience; Intelligent transport systems; Interview; Mobility service; Users’ acceptance","Automation; Roads and streets; Surveys; Automated vehicles; Level of autonomies; Mobility service; On demands; Peri-urban areas; System capabilities; Train stations; Vehicle speed; Vehicles","","","","","ANRT FUI","Authors thank ANRT FUI Tornado project to partially fund this work.

The message from tourism was that this was great for Yorkshire because businesses would be making money; politicians were also telling local people to feel happy that they had won the right to host Le Tour. In this paper, I will reflect on what happened when Le Tour came to Yorkshire through an analysis of newspaper reports, photographs taken by myself two years on from the two days Le Tour arrived in Yorkshire, and an auto-ethnographic account of what it was like to be there. I will argue that Le Tour allowed local communities to embrace a cosmopolitan European identity alongside their existing northern English or Yorkshire identities, and that the race itself allowed spectators to be proud about the northern English landscape through which the cyclists battled. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Community; cycling; identity; leisure Le Tour de France; tourism; Yorkshire","article; bread; cyclist; France; human; photography; race; tourism","","","","","","","Adorno T., The Culture Industry, (1991); Barthes R., Mythologies, (2009); Berridge G., The Promotion of Cycling in London: The Impact of the 2007 Tour de France Grand Depart on the Image and Provision of Cycling in the Capital, Journal of Sport & Tourism, 17, 1, pp. 43-61, (2012); Clarke H.D., Goodwin M.J., Goodwin M., Whiteley P., Brexit, (2017); (2013); Ferbrache F., Le Tour de France: A Cultural Geography of a Mega-Event, Geography, 98, 3, pp. 144-151, (2013); Geertz C., The Interpretation of Cultures, (2010); Gramsci A., Selections from Prison Notebooks, (1971); Grant A., Mega‐Events and Nationalism: The 2008 Olympic Torch Relay, Geographical Review, 104, 2, pp. 192-208, (2014); Grix J., Lee D., Soft Power, Sports Mega-Events and Emerging States: The Lure of the Politics of Attraction, Global Society, 27, 4, pp. 521-536, (2013); Habermas J., The Theory of Communicative Action, Volume One: Reason and the Rationalization of Society, (1984); Habermas J., The Theory of Communicative Action, Volume Two: The Critique of Functionalist Reason, (1987); Hobsbawm E., Ranger T., The Invention of Tradition, (1983); Hesse D., Warrior Dreams: Playing Scotsmen in Mainland Europe, (2014); Koch N., The Geopolitics of Sport beyond Soft Power: Event Ethnography and the 2016 Cycling World Championships in Qatar, Sport in Society, 21, 12, pp. 2010-2031, (2018); Kumar K., English and French National Identity: Comparisons and Contrasts, Nations and Nationalism, 12, 3, pp. 413-432, (2006); Lamont M., Authentication in Sports Tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 45, 1, pp. 1-17, (2014); Lefebvre H., Critique of Everyday Life, (2014); Moore L., Passengers Hand over Petition Protesting at Reduced Bus Service, (2014); Moore L., Craven Reap the Benefit of Last Year’s Grand Depart, (2015); Murphy M.P.A., The Empire Strikes Back: Towards a Marxist Critique of Soccer in Sub-Saharan Africa, Sport in Society, 20, 9, pp. 1271-1280, (2017); Paramio-Salcines J.L., Barquin R.R., Arroyo M.J.B., Identity of Cities and Event Sport Tourism: The Grand Depart Tour de France 2015, Cuadernos de Turismo, 40, pp. 711-714, (2017); Peaslee R.M., One Ring, Many Circles: The Hobbiton Tour Experience and a Spatial Approach to Media Power, Tourist Studies, 11, 1, pp. 37-53, (2011); Redhead S., Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Hooligans: Low Sport Journalism and Hit‐and‐Tell Literature, Soccer & Society, 11, 5, pp. 627-642, (2010); Rojek C., The Labour of Leisure, (2010); Savage M., Social Class in the Twenty-First Century, (2015); Schnitzer M., Scheiber S., Kornexl E., Thoni E., Politicians’ Perspective on the Community-Related Impacts of Major Sports Events: A Case Study for Innsbruck-Tyrol, Sport in Society, 20, 7, pp. 880-904, (2017); Seippel O., Do Sports Matter to People?

There is a similar problem in track cycling, where a cyclist aims to find the trajectory on the curved sloping surface of a velodrome that results in the minimum lap time. In this paper, we extend the classical Brachistochrone problem to find the optimum cycling trajectory in a velodrome, treating the cyclist as an active particle. Starting with two canonical cases of cycling on a sloping plane and a cone, where analytical solutions are found, we then solve the problem numerically on the reconstructed surface of the velodrome in Montigny le Bretonneux, France. Finally, we discuss the parameters of the problem and the effects of fatigue. © 2020 The Author(s).","active particles; brachistochrone; cycling; optimization","A-particles; Active particles; Brachistochrone problems; Classical physics; Reconstructed surfaces; Sloping surfaces; Vertical plane; Engineering","","","","","Ecole Polytechnique","Data accessibility.

The added features were deemed necessary to study road-bicycle interactions. We equipped the simulator platform with: three actuators to render the road profile vibrations, an asphalt specimen attached to the rear tire to render the road adhesion, and a new virtual reality environment to render a part of the city of Vanves in France. Simultaneously, we developed a mathematical model with 6 degrees of freedom including the three rotational angles (Yaw, Pitch and Roll) and their influence on vertical, lateral and longitudinal modeling. In order to validate the simulator and the developed model physically and subjectively, we conducted an experiment involving 36 participants who rode the simulator for around 600 meters with full control on the handlebar, pedals and brakes. The improved simulator/mathematical model will be employed to further study bicycle dynamics, cyclist behavior and the interaction with the infrastructure and other road users.  © 2013 IEEE.","Bicycle modeling; bicycle simulator; experimental validation; road characteristics; simulation","Bicycles; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Roads and streets; Simulators; Bicycle dynamics; Developed model; Full control; Longitudinal models; Road profile; Road users; Rotational angle; Virtual-reality environment; Virtual reality","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (765057); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA","This work was supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions [Horizon 2020 Model Grant Agreement for Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (H2020 MGA MSCA-ITN)] through the SAFERUP Project under Agreement 765057.","Shoman M., Imine H., Modeling and simulation of bicycle dynamics, Proc.

This paper aims to study the impact of the road characteristics, such as road gradient, type of road and pavement surface of the road, on cyclists’ behavior using dedicated modules of MATSim. For that, we compare two approaches: a standard approach which does not consider the road characteristics, and a second approach that uses MATSim bicycle extension of Ziemke et al. The two approaches are analyzed over a sub-regional area around a district, focusing on a suburban city with an undulating relief made of average-to-steep hills. The focus is on the bicycle transportation model because the catchment area has a particularly challenging altitude profile and a large variety of roads, whether in type—from residential to national highway—or in pavement surface due to the number of green areas, such as parks and forests. This area is defined as a rather large 7 × 12 km, including five suburban cities in the South of Paris, France. A synthetic population of 126,000 agents was generated at a regional scale, with chains of activity made of work, education, shopping, leisure, restaurant and kindergarten, with activity-time choice, location choice and modal choice. We wanted to know how accurately a standard model of bicycle travels can be made with a 2D flat Earth assumption by comparing it to an algorithm extension that explicitly considers road characteristics in cyclists’ route choices. Our finding is that the MATSim bicycle extension model impacts mainly the long trips. Otherwise, the differences are minimal between the two models in terms of travel time and travel distance. © 2022 by the authors.","activity-based model; bicycle simulation model; cycling infrastructure; cycling route choice; MATSim; synthetic population","","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-16-IDEX-0003)","This research was funded by the E3S project, a partnership between Eiffage and the I-SITE FUTURE consortium.

In endurance sports, intensity has been measured using heart rate or RPE, giving rise to load indexes such as sRPE or TRIMP. In cycling, the advent of power meters led to new indexes, such as TSS. All these indexes have limitations, especially for high intensity exercise. Therefore, a new index for cycling is proposed, the Power Profile Index (PPi), which includes a weighting factor obtained from the relative exercise intensity and stage type. Using power data from 67 WorldTour cyclists and fatigue records in different stage types from 102 road cyclists, weighting factors for intensity and stage type were determined. Subsequently, the PPi was computed and compared to current indexes using data from a WorldTour team during the 2018 Tour de France. The proposed index showed a strong correlation with perceived fatigue as a function of stage type (R2 = 0.9996), as well as no differences in the load quantification in different types of stage profiles (p = 0.292), something that does not occur with other indexes such as TSS, RPE, or eTRIMP (p < 0.001). Therefore, PPi is a new index capable of quantifying the high intensity efforts that produce greater fatigue, as well as considering the stage type. © 2022 by the authors.","RPE; TRIMP; TSS; type of stage; workload quantification; WorldTour cyclists","","","","","","","","Bourdon P.C., Cardinale M., Murray A., Gastin P., Kellmann M., Varley M.C., Gabbett T.J., Coutts A.J., Burgess D.J., Gregson W., Et al., Monitoring Athlete Training Loads: Consensus Statement, Int.

In these years, the Spanish press insisted on the idea that the cyclists who competed in the race not only struggle to win the competition; they did it also for the honor of the nation and to demonstrate the value of national masculinity to the rest of the world. However, as the successes of the Spanish cyclists were not usual, the newspapers feel the necessity to justify this situation. They did it by appealing to persistent bad luck and opposition from the organization. Through newspapers, this article analyzes the way in which mass media explained the lack of victories of the Spanish representatives in the Tour of France. To do that, they used similar ideas than the applied to justify the defeats of the men’s national football team. The reason why they tried so hard to justify the absence of triumphs was because it was understood that the national dignity and virility of Spanish men were at stake, so the justification had to be credible, plausible and furthermore, had to encourage the patriotic sentiment and national pride. © 2022 FahrenHouse.

Some mobility scholars describe habits as regularly evolving. Several psychologists, on the other hand, observe radical changes originating from disruptions in our environment. I show that these two perspectives can be integrated using Berger and Luckmann’s model of individual change. In the first phase, a shock from the environment disrupt a habit or habits, which are later replaced by new habits progressively learned as part of a group. I applied this model to two French bike workshops active in cycling subculture. I used interviews and participant observation in the two workshops to examine how communities potentially lead their members to change their body habits (their way of moving, seeing, touching), their perception of the car and social mobility, and to adopt a radical definition of the “good life”. I found that the depth and breadth of habit change depended on the individual’s involvement in the bike workshop and of the type of shock he/she experienced. As a result, I show how an instance of the cycling subculture transforms habits, both progressively and radically, by strengthening the relationship between individuals and their bikes. The article opens the path to applications of Berger and Luckmann’s theory to mobility. © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, we focus on cycling in Belgium. During the spring of each year, a unique type of one-day professional cycling race is organised in Belgium and France: cobblestone races (e.g. Tour of Flanders). These are very popular among the public in Flanders, Belgium because of their long history and current Belgian cyclists’ strong performances in them. We focus on a key element of social capital: trust in others. Using online survey data from a long-running study by the Flemish Government (N = 33,671), we analyse whether Belgian cyclists’ performances in and television ratings of cobblestone races are associated with various types of trust among the Flemish public. Results indicate that strong Belgian performances in cobblestone races are associated with greater neighbourhood trust, while high television ratings are also associated with greater trust. Some of these effects are moderated by age and gender. We discuss the implications of our findings and avenues of future research on the role of locally popular sports in the development of social capital. © 2022 European Association for Sociology of Sport.","Belgium; cycling; road racing; Social capital; social cohesion; trust","","","","","","Socio-Cultural Shifts in Flanders-dataset","The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

A route was ridden identically on 33 spring and summer evenings on a bike fitted out with measuring instruments (VeloClim). These evenings followed sunny calm days conducive to the formation of thermal contrasts and urban heat islands (UHIs). Two typologies, Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Local Climate Zones (LCZ), are used to assess the impact of urban form and land cover on air temperatures based on ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA). ANOVA is applied to the mean of runs to maximize the effect of surface states, and to each run individually to maximize the influence of weather conditions. The results show that both typologies prove relevant and complementary for studying the impact of vegetated and artificialized zones on urban temperature. Temperature variations on intra-urban scales are significantly modulated by urban form and land cover types. Vegetated areas are systematically cooler than impervious surfaces. Independently of meteorological conditions, urban form has a decisive influence on air temperature and each CLC or LCZ category has an original air temperature signature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","ANalysis of VAriance; Iterated transect; LCZ; Thermal impacts; UHI; Urban form","","","","","","Bourgogne Franche-Comté; CCuB; Centre de Calcul de l'Université de Bourgogne; ERC H2020, (957751); Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l'Energie, ADEME","The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

This paper studies a two-echelon vehicle routing problem, one of the most employed models, with a heterogeneous fleet between echelons. Vehicles in the first echelon are mobile satellites that supply the vehicles in the second echelon. Our study aims to minimize the travel time. To solve this complex problem when facing real-life distribution, a heuristic solution approach is followed by decomposing the components of the problem and applying the well-known nearest neighbor procedure. This approach is also justified by the very large amount of delivery points, so the problem dataset can be computationally tractable. Experiments are run using real data from a delivery company in Paris, France. Different scenarios are evaluated, and results show that the consideration of cargo bikes has big potential to reduce some of the externalities caused by conventional delivery systems, while some non-intuitive impacts are also found, such as the increase in land use. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Cargo Bikes; Retail; Supply Chain Management; Sustainability; Two-Echelon Distribution; Urban Logistics","","","","","","Universidad de La Sabana; Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia and Kedge Business School, (INGPHD-52-2022, INGPHD-10-2019)","The work of the first author was carried out under a post-graduate scholarship awarded by Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia and Kedge Business School, France.

These services can help shape sustainable cities and reduce car dependency. To unlock their full potential, a deep understanding of these services' operation, adoption, and integration within existing mobility systems is required. This paper uses a newly introduced agent-based simulation framework to study the implications of shared bikes and e-scooters in Lyon, France. The paper describes data collection, processing, and input data generation for the simulation of shared bikes and e-scooters. Simulation outcomes evaluate the impact of introducing these services on existing travel modes. The introduction of shared bikes and e-scooters can compete against public transit and walking. The simulation framework can be used to assess various aspects of shared bikes and e-scooters and help policy-makers take advantage of their full potential to improve urban mobility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) native T1/T2 mapping is sensitive to the pathological increase of myocardial water content. Therefore, we evaluated exercise-induced acute myocardial changes in recreational cyclists by incorporating biomarkers, echocardiography and CMR. Methods: Nineteen male recreational participants (age: 48 ± 5 years) cycled the ‘L’étape du tour de France” (EDT) 2021’ (175 km, 3600 altimeters). One week before the race, a maximal graded cycling test was conducted to determine individual heart rate (HR) training zones. One day before and 3–6 h post-exercise 3 T CMR and echocardiography were performed to assess myocardial native T1/T2 relaxation times and cardiac function, and blood samples were collected. All participants were asked to cycle 2 h around their anaerobic gas exchange threshold (HR zone 4). Results: Eighteen participants completed the EDT stage in 537 ± 58 min, including 154 ± 61 min of cycling time in HR zone 4. Post-race right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with reduced strain and increased volumes (p < 0.05) and borderline significant left ventricular global longitudinal strain reduction (p = 0.05) were observed. Post-exercise cTnI (0.75 ± 5.1 ng/l to 69.9 ± 41.6 ng/l; p < 0.001) and T1 relaxation times (1133 ± 48 ms to 1182 ± 46 ms, p < 0.001) increased significantly with no significant change in T2 (p = 0.474). cTnI release correlated with increase in T1 relaxation time (p = 0.002; r = 0.703), post-race RV dysfunction (p < 0.05; r = 0.562) and longer cycling in HR zone 4 (p < 0.05; r = 0.607). Conclusion: Strenuous exercise causes early post-race cTnI increase, increased T1 relaxation time and RV dysfunction in recreational cyclists, which showed interdependent correlation. The long-term clinical significance of these changes needs further investigation. Trial registration numbers and date: NCT 04940650 06/18/2021.

Because of their high speed, these vehicles are not classified as bicycles in the European Union. However, their external aspect and their mode of propulsion—the user needs to pedal for the electric assistance to work—make them part of the symbolic universe of bicycles. This raises the following question: should these vehicles ride on cycle lanes, or on the road? The authors argue that answering this question implies understanding both how these vehicles are used, and how speed e-bike users perceive themselves. How do users experience their high-velocity bikes? Using qualitative interviews with speed e-bike users in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, this research offers novel data on the actual usage of this emerging mode of transport and what it represents symbolically to users. Results show that speed e-bike users consider themselves as cyclists and value the opportunity to ride on cycle lanes, whether this is allowed or not. However, they self-regulate their positioning on the road depending on their actual speed. When they want to accelerate, speed e-bike users tend to leave bike lanes to ensure their own safety as well as that of other cyclists. These results allow a case to be made for a speed-based regulation according to which riders could use different segments of the public space alternatively depending on their actual speed at a given moment. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022.","bicycle transportation; bicycles; cycle lanes; e-bikes; electric bicycles; human factors; pedestrians; planning and policy","Electric vehicles; Roads and streets; Sporting goods; Belgium; Bicycle transportation; Classifieds; Cycle lane; Electric bicycles; High Speed; Pedestrian; Planning and policy; Public space; Switzerland; Bicycles","","","","","","","Jones T., Harms L., Heinen Motives E., Perceptions and Experiences of Electric Bicycle Owners and Implications for Health, Wellbeing and Mobility, Journal of Transport Geography, 53, pp. 41-49, (2016); Parsons R., Vigar G., Resistance was Futile!’’ Cycling’s Discourses of Resistance to UK Automobile Modernism 1950–1970, Planning Perspectives, 33, 2, pp. 163-183, (2018); Hubbard P., Lilley K., Pacemaking the Modern City: The Urban Politics of Speed and Slowness, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 22, 2, pp. 273-294, (2004); De Bruijne R.

France experimented with a €50 bike repair subsidy. Our questionnaire survey (n = 7343) focuses on beneficiaries’ sociological profiles. Despite its success in quantitative terms, the repair subsidy benefited more regular cyclists—who cycle daily—and people who are confident cycling in urban areas. Women were more likely to benefit than men, and people in low-income households more than those in high-income households. Because these populations are usually underrepresented among cyclists in France, the scheme may appear to have reduced inequities in cycling. However, the scheme could have reached out more to the low-income population who were largely unaware of it. This selectivity is partly explained by awareness of the subsidy, which is lower among the younger and the less educated part of the population. Our survey shows that the scheme is selective primarily because of its design. It would have been necessary to accompany it with measures specifically designed for vulnerable groups. © 2023","Covid-19; Cycling; Financial incentives; Gender inequalities; Social inequalities","France; Covid-19; Cycling; Financial incentives; Gender inequality; Low incomes; Questionnaire surveys; Social inequalities; Urban areas; Vulnerable groups; COVID-19; cycle transport; gender relations; incentive; low income population; quantitative analysis; questionnaire survey; subsidy system; transportation planning; transportation policy; vulnerability; Repair","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-20-COV1-000)","The “Vélotactique” research project, in which the data were collected, was supported by the French National Research Agency [Vélotactique project, ANR-20-COV1-000 , 2020–2022].

In this paper, first, we aim to customize the discrete choice model for Île-de-France scenario and estimate its initial parameterization via the routing API OpenTripPlanner. The goal of this step is to reproduce the travel patterns observed from the regional Household Travel Survey (HTS) in MATSim without running any time-consuming simulation. Since the modeled cycling behavior could impact strongly the mode choice decision on bike, we evaluate the cycling routing with disaggregated GPS traces obtained dynamically from the mobile application Geovelo. The objective of this pre-calibration and evaluation is to provide a solid base for our future work which aims to calibrate the cycling flow per link in MATSim for Paris with the normalized flow from recent crowdsensing data. © 2021 The Authors.

Methods: Since level-5 AVs are not on the road yet, or are too rare, we simulated their introduction into traffic using a national database of all fatal crashes and 5% of injury crashes observed in France in 2011. We fictitiously replaced a certain proportion of light vehicles (LVs) involved in crashes by level-5 AVs, and applied crash avoidance probabilities estimated by a number of experts regarding the capabilities of AVs depending on specific configurations. Estimates of the percentage of avoided crashes per user configuration and according to three selected (10%, 50%, 100%) replacement levels were made, as well as estimates taking into account the relative weight of these crash configurations, and considering fatal and injury crashes separately. Results: Our simulation suggests that a reduction of almost half of fatal crashes (56%) and injury crashes (46%) could be expected by replacing all LVs on the road with level-5 AVs. The introduction of AVs would be the least effective for crashes involving a vulnerable road user, especially motorcyclists. Conclusion: This result represents encouraging prospects for the introduction of automated vehicles into traffic, while making it clear that, even with all light vehicles replaced with level 5-AVs, all issues would not be solved, especially for crashes involving motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians. © 2021, The Author(s).","Automated driving; Automated vehicle; Replacement level; Road crashes; Safety","Automation; Highway accidents; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Automated driving; Automated light vehicles; Automated vehicles; Crash avoidance; Fatal crashes; Injury crashes; Level 5; Light vehicles; Replacement level; Road crash; Motorcycles","","","","","European Center for Studies on Safety; LAB; Laboratory of Accidentology and Biomechanics, (GIE PSA-Renault); National Center for Studies and Expertise on Risks, Environment, Mobility and Town; Fondation Sécurité Routière, FSR","Funding text 1: Data come from the coding of a police data collection.

Methods: Week‐by‐week power meter training and racing data of 2 (A and B) road cyclists (age: 29 and 23 y; maximum oxygen consumption: 83 and 81 mL·min−1·kg−1; and relative 20‐min record power output: 6.9 and 6.5 W·kg−1) in the preparation phase (December–July/August) leading up to the Tour de France were retrospectively analyzed. Weekly volume and intensity distribution in power zones were considered. Results: Cyclists A and B completed 46 and 19 races, 22.5 (6.3) and 18.2 (5.1) h·wk−1, with a pyramidal intensity distribution of 81.0%–13.3%–5.7%, and 88.8%–7.9%–3.3% in zone 1–zone 2–zone 3. Cyclist B spent 14 days at altitude. Increased high-intensity volume and polarization index occurred during race weeks. During periods without racing, training intensity progressively increased. Strength training was performed during November and December but not during the following months. During tapering, total exercise volume and time at high intensity decreased. Conclusion: These data provide novel insights into the periodization of world-class road cyclists in advance of a top 5 placing in the Tour de France general classification. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.","elite cyclists; endurance training: grand tour; road cycling","Bicycling; Competitive Behavior; France; Humans; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Endurance; Retrospective Studies; altitude; article; controlled study; cyclist; endurance training; exercise; France; human; maximal oxygen uptake; polarization; race; resistance training; retrospective study; competitive behavior; cycling; endurance; France; oxygen consumption","","","","","","","Gallo G, Leo P, March MM, Et al., Differences in training characteristics between junior, under 23 and professional cyclists, Int J Sports Med, 43, 14, pp. 1183-1189, (2022); Svendsen IS, Tonnesen E, Tjelta LI, Orn S., Training, performance, and physiological predictors of a successful elite senior career in junior competitive road cyclists, Int J Sports Physiol Perform, 13, 10, pp. 1287-1292, (2018); Gallo G, Bosio A, Martin M, Et al., Relationships between training dose and record power outputs in professional road cyclists: insights and threats to validity, Biol Sport, 40, 2, pp. 485-495, (2023); Van Erp T, Sanders D, De Koning JJ., Training characteristics of male and female professional road cyclists: a 4-year retrospective analysis, Int J Sports Physiol Perform, 15, 4, pp. 534-540, (2020); Gallo G, Mateo-March M, Gotti D, Et al., How do world class top 5 Giro d’Italia finishers train?

This political will is also pursued in France where the modal share of cycling is relatively low. However, young people and those with a high level of human capital, such as members of the university community, are observed to be more advanced in their adoption of cycling. An understanding of how cycling is used by university students and staff would therefore help to inform public decision-making and support more efficient targeted policies to develop this mode of transport. Using original data from the MobiCampus-UdL project, the aim of this article is to analyze the determinants of bicycle use by the university community at the University of Lyon, France. Two multivariate logistic regression models are estimated on the subsamples of students and staff: one explaining the probability of using the bicycle as an exclusive mode of transport to get to the campus and the other explaining the probability of using the bicycle in combination with other modes. Our results suggest that while socio-demographic characteristics have little influence within our two relatively homogeneous subsamples, access to mobility resources and the spatial characteristics of the campus and place of residence are crucial. We also find that access to bicycles is an important determinant of the utilization of cycling. Given that the adoption of cycling is still very low, our findings justify policies to increase the availability of bicycles and subsidize their purchase. More specifically, our results suggest that access to a shared bike station on campus encourages the exclusive use of bicycles by students and staff but has no effect when used in combination with other modes. On the other hand, good accessibility to public transport, whether from home or from campus, does not reduce the use of bicycles by either sub-population, either exclusively or in combination. Furthermore, while living far from the city center is an obstacle to the exclusive use of the bicycles, especially for staff, it does not in any way prevent their use in combination with other modes, such as the train. These results open up new avenues for anticipating the development of intermodality between public transport and cycling. © 2024, University of Minnesota.

In particular, the issue of travel for the university community has become a major concern. One of the main objectives of the UdL Mobility Plan, in addition to improving the accessibility of the campuses and university sites, is to reduce the use of the car, which is more polluting and takes up more space, in favor of alternative modes of transport. A recent UdL assessment showed that, on average, home-to-work travel accounts for 14% of the carbon footprint of its institutions (Universit\u00E9 de Lyon, 2022). In this context, the Labex IMU - Intelligence of Urban Worlds Laboratory of Excellence - decided to fund the MobiCampus-UdL project, carried out by the Transport Urban Planning Economics Laboratory with the support of the University of Lyon and the Lyon Urban Community. Its aim is to understand the daily travel behavior of the university community in Lyon in order to help campus managers to plan coherent mobility management policies.","Andersen L.

Thus, in this paper, I use (i) the Shannon intrinsic entropy (S) as an indicator of “teams sporting value” (or “competition performance”) and (ii) the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHi) as a “teams competitive balance” indicator, in the case of (professional) cyclist multi-stage races. The 2022 Tour de France and 2023 Tour of Oman are used for numerical illustrations and discussion. The numerical values are obtained from classical and and new ranking indices which measure the teams “final time”, on one hand, and “final place”, on the other hand, based on the “best three” riders in each stage, but also the corresponding times and places throughout the race, for these finishing riders. The analysis data demonstrate that the constraint, “only the finishing riders count”, makes much sense for obtaining a more objective measure of “team value” and team performance”, at the end of a multi-stage race. A graphical analysis allows us to distinguish various team levels, each exhibiting a Feller-Pareto distribution, thereby indicating self-organized processes. In so doing, one hopefully better relates objective scientific measures to sport team competitions. Moreover, this analysis proposes some paths to elaborate on forecasting through standard probability concepts. © 2023 by the author.","competitive balance; Herfindahl-Hirschman index; professional cyclist races; Shannon intrinsic entropy; teams ranking; Tour de France; Tour of Oman","","","","","","","","De Condorcet N., Essai sur L’application de L’analyse a la Probabilité des Décisions Rendues à la Pluralité des Voix, (1785); Arrow K., A difficulty in the theory of social welfare, J.

This study aims to quantify this difference in exposure during daily travel, by carrying out a micro-sensor measurement campaign. The pollutant exposure was assessed simultaneously over predefined routes in order to allow comparison between different transport modes having the same starting and ending points. During the six-week measurement campaign, the average reference values for PM background concentrations were 13.72 and 17.92μg/m3 for the PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The results revealed that the mode with the highest exposure to PM2.5 adjusted to background concentration (PM2.5Norm) was the bus (1.65) followed by metro (1.51), walking (1.33), tramway (1.31), car (1.09) and finally the bike (1.06). For PM10Norm, the tramway had the highest exposure (1.86), followed by walking (1.68), metro (1.65), bus (1.61), bike (1.43) and finally the car (1.39). The level of urbanization around the route and the presence of preferential lanes for public transportation influenced the concentration to which commuters were exposed. For the active modes (bike and walking), we observed frequent variations in concentrations during the trip, characterized by punctual peaks in concentration, depending on the local characteristics of road traffic and urban morphology. Fluctuations in particulate matter inside public transport vehicles were partly explained by the opening and closing of doors during stops, as well as the passenger flows, influencing the re-suspension of particles. The car was one of the least exposed modes overall, with the lowest concentration variability, although these concentrations can vary greatly depending on the ventilation parameters used. These results encourage measures to move the most exposed users away from road traffic, by developing a network of lanes entirely dedicated to cycling and walking, particularly in densely populated areas, as well as encouraging the renewal of motorized vehicles to use less polluting fuels with efficient ventilation systems. © 2024 The Authors","Air pollution; Commuter exposure; Low-cost sensor; Particulate matter; Transport mode; Urban air quality","Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; France; Humans; Particulate Matter; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; Air quality; Costs; Microsensors; Particles (particulate matter); Roads and streets; Transportation routes; Background concentration; Commuter exposure; High exposures; Low-cost sensors; Measurement campaign; Particulate Matter; PM 10; PM 2.5; Transport modes; Urban air quality; airborne survey; commuting; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public transport; road traffic; sensor; transportation mode; urbanization; ventilation; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; atmospheric particulate matter; comparative study; concentration (parameter); cycling; female; France; human; meteorology; metropolitan area; microenvironment; motor vehicle; PM10 exposure; PM2.5 exposure; pollution exposure; population density; reference value; traffic; travel; urban area; urbanization; walking; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; procedures; traffic and transport; Urban transportation","","Air Pollutants, ; Particulate Matter, ; Vehicle Emissions, ","","","Universiteit Maastricht, UM; LMFA; Auvergne Rhones Alpes Canceropole; Ligue Contre le Cancer, France; Fondation de France, France; European Neuroendocrine Association, ENEA; Agence Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire de l’Alimentation, de l’Environnement et du Travail, ANSES; ANSES, (2019/1/242); CLARA, (OS11-58); Ligue Contre le Cancer, (IP/SC-16639, 00099901); Fondation de France, (0099899)","Funding text 1: The authors are deeply grateful to all participants (chiefly colleagues and friends from LMFA and CLB) who made the measurement campaign possible.

They are a cheaper, cleaner and efficient means of transport that can help counter global warming. Currently there are over 40 million e-bikes in the world. Their initial patents were registered in offices in both France and the United States. French technology featured a three-wheel electric model without pedals which could be controlled with a hand lever system. In the US, a battery-powered bicycle was developed. This bicycle had its hub motor mounted inside the rear wheel. Its battery was placed inside the central triable of the frame. Such a concept is similar to the modern motorcycles. With demand and innovation, the earliest mass production of e-bikes began in the 20th century. The bikes gained immense popularity in the European markets. These models were high in power and potential. Initially Phillips and Simplex collaborated to make the 1932 Phillips Simplex Electric bike. Gradually Japanese players like Panasonic (1975) and Sanyo Enacle (1989) entered the market. Rising competition in the field promoted higher innovation in the sector. By the early 2000s e-bikes had gained enough popularity and went by names like power-bike, Pedelec, Pedalassisted, etc. Today e-bikes come with high-end technology, making them more reliable, comfortable and long-lasting. Some bikers also modify their bikes with custom tires, fittings and appearances. Such bikes are also called hybrid bikes and are used in bike sports as well. With functions ranging from off-roading, sports to daily use, e-bikes are all set to become the bike of the future. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Hand lever system; hub motor; hybrid bikes; pedal-assisted; pedelec; power-bike","","","","","","","","Gogola M., Are the e-bikes more dangerous than traditional bicycles?, 2018 XI International Science-Technical Conference Automotive Safety, pp. 1-4, (2018); Juare C.M.I., Rocillo L.L., Suterio D.L.E., Raguindin E.Q., Tilting Advisory and Prevention (TAP) Device for Bicycles, TENCON 2018-2018 IEEE Region 10 Conference, pp. 2561-2565, (2018); Singh A., Ali M.T., Appaji, IoT Based Parameters Calculation of Electric Bicycle using OpenModelica Simulation Tool with Data Analytics Technology, 2022 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing and Electrical Circuits and Electronics (ICDCECE), pp. 1-4, (2022); Chun K.-W., Chen Z.-H., Sun C.-C., IOT solution for public bicycle system, 2016 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Taiwan (ICCE-TW), pp. 1-2, (2016); Nath S., Sinha S., Gladence L.M., BevishJinila Y., Rajalakshmi V., Health analysis of bicycle rider and security of bicycle using IoT, 2017 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP), pp. 0802-0806, (2017); Almeida R.S., Cherullo R., Radetic D., Francy G., Silva-Calpa M., Raposo A.B., Exploring Motor and Sensory Devices in a Bicycle Simulator, 2019 21st Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR), pp. 232-241, (2019); Aliyadin A.Z., Purwadi A., Hidayat S., Performance Analysis and Design of 250 Watt Outer Rotor BLDC Motor for Urban Electric Bicycles, 2022 7th International Conference on Electric Vehicular Technology (ICEVT), pp. 195-199, (2022); Yang O., Griggs W.M., Connected e-Bicycle Platoons at Unsignalised Intersections, 2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC), pp. 1875-1882, (2021); Alfiany N., Hamid N., Jati G., Ma'sum M.A., Jatmiko W., Kinematics and Dynamics Analysis of an Autonomous Three-wheeled Bicycle Modeling, 2019 4th Asia-Pacific Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems (ACIRS), pp. 17-21, (2019); Gandhi A., Mistri S.R., Gangrade A.K., Design and Performance Testing of an E-Bicycle, 2021 3rd International Conference on Sustainable Technologies for Industry 4.0 (STI), pp. 1-6, (2021); Gonzalez R., Fajardo L., Florez D., A Prototype to Manage the Share of Assisted Bicycles on Bogota as a Creative form of Public Transportation, 2018 ICAI Workshops (ICAIW), pp. 1-6, (2018); Radrizzani S., Panzani G., Corno M., Savaresi S.M., A concurrent controllers integration strategy to enhance the riding experience in bicycle driveline emulators, 2021 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA), pp. 1043-1048, (2021); Lan T.-S., Zhang H.-W., Gao J.-S., Dai X.-J., Design and Optimizated Simulation of Bicycle Frame Structure, 2020 IEEE Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE), pp. 301-304, (2020); Oberle M., Stohr M., Brandstetter A., Gartner S., Design and Development of a Cyber-Physical System E-Bike Retrofit Prototype, 2022 IEEE 27th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), pp. 1-8, (2022); Silva N.C.D., Et al., An Experimental Study on Smart Electric Bicycle with Weight Minimized Power Pack, 2021 3rd International Conference on Electrical Engineering (EECon), pp. 80-86, (2021); Guidon S., Becker H., Axhausen K., Avoiding stranded bicycles in free-floating bicycle-sharing systems: Using survival analysis to derive operational rules for rebalancing, 2019 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC), pp. 1703-1708, (2019); Duz A., Corno M., Flexible Pricing Strategies in Electric Free-Floating Bicycle Sharing, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 152972-152983, (2021); Huber S., Lissner S., Lindemann P., Muthmann K., Schnabel A., Friedl J., Modelling bicycle route choice in German cities using open data, MNL and the bikeSim web-app, 2021 7th International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS), pp. 1-6, (2021); Xiong C., Et al., Static Balancing of Robotic Bicycle through Nonlinear Modeling and Control, 2018 3rd International Conference on Robotics and Automation Engineering (ICRAE), pp. 24-28, (2018); Huang X.-H., Chen Z.-H., Ahamad A., Sun C.-C., ADAS E-Bike:Auxiliary ADAS Module For Electric Power-assisted Bicycle, 2022 IET International Conference on Engineering Technologies and Applications (IETICETA), pp. 1-2, (2022); Tabei F., Askarian B., Chong J.W., Accident Detection System for Bicycle Riders, IEEE Sens.

Bicycle traffic flows have generally been well documented, with particular focus on utilitarian trips during lockdowns. However, little research has examined the profiles of social groups affected by changes in bicycle use. That is the purpose of this article, which examines the socio-spatial factors behind changes in utilitarian and recreational cycle use. Methods: The study is based on a nationwide questionnaire completed by 7343 cyclists in France between May and October 2021. The analyses are based on bivariate treatments, tests of independence, logistic regressions, and additional comments by some respondents (n = 1594). Results: Our results show both utility and leisure cycling were more likely to have increased than decreased over the period under study. However, while utility practice was driven by fear of Covid-19 but inhibited by teleworking, recreational practice was driven by both working-at-home and by the desire to get out for some physical exercise. Compensatory phenomena, blurring the boundary between leisure and utility, are perceptible. Reductions in both the gender gap and the income gap in bicycle use are measured. However, since these were mainly forced changes and since inequalities in access to cycling persist, the narrowing of these gaps cannot be interpreted as steps toward gender or class equality. Conclusions: The article recommends further research to assess the persistence of observed changes in leisure and utility cycling. At the same time, it warns against the pitfall of considering that a reduction in inequalities in cycling practices implies a reduction in social inequalities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Covid-19; Cycling; Leisure cycling; Social inequality; Teleworking; Utility cycling","","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-20-COV1-000)","The “Vélotactique” research project, in which the data were collected, was supported by the French National Research Agency [Vélotactique project, ANR-20-COV1-000, 2020–2022 ].

Urban public transport in France is characterized by the public organization, AOM—Mobility Organizing Authorities, which are established for each urban agglomeration and partially financed by mobility levy (versement mobilité—VM) levied on employers. Hence, this chapter also touches upon loss of fare income and VM during the pandemic, the impact of the rise of work-from-home, and the public transport's response to it. This chapter finds that the policy coordination and financial assistance from the national government in response to the pandemic to the AOMs was inadequate. It suggests that work-from-home does not seem a primary contributor to reduced mobility, rather it has led to a different distribution of trips during the day and the week, contributing to flattening the morning and evening peak hours of public transport. Finally, it observes that the occurrence of the pandemic has led to an increase in the number of cyclists in many French cities; although this shift to low-carbon modes of transport has displaced public transport users rather than car users, this chapter proposes careful attention to seeking balance from car transport to mass and active transport. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

The use of a multi-agent simulation tool allows for a more realistic and accurate representation of individual transportation behavior and enables transportation planners to evaluate the impact of proposed changes on the entire transportation network. To this end, we use MATSIM (MultiAgent Traffic Simulation) tool to develop the considered scenario in which a network update is operated by developing bicycle stations and new transport lines. The simulation parameters used in this study were adapted to the French population based on the MATSim Ile de France scenario, ensuring that the simulation results were applicable and relevant to the transportation system in the Rouen Metropole Normandy region. The main obtained results shows an increase in bike usage (+1.8%) and car-sharing (+1.4%), and a decrease in travel time (-6%). These findings suggest the potential benefits of eco-friendly transportation modes and the need for solutions to address traffic congestion. © 2023 IEEE.","agent-based simulation; MaaS; MATSIM; Multimodal transport system;

Yet a lack of disaggregated modal data makes it unclear who does and who does not have access to biking. An intersectional analysis of 19 narrative and semi-structured interviews with policymakers, residents with different identities, and bike service providers demonstrate that some people perceive unique barriers to biking, related to their identities. For example, this study finds that racism, financial precarity, a lack of accessible information about services, and spatial inequalities may prevent some people from biking despite Grenoble's advanced cycling infrastructure and services and that these barriers may compound for certain people, reinforcing the preliminary body of research on intersectional barriers to urban biking. The study further finds that the lack of disaggregated demographic data on urban mobility in France might be preventing inclusive bike policy. The paper concludes by arguing that local policymakers would benefit from applying an intersectional analysis in understanding who is and is not biking, to promote everyday biking in a more inclusive way. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Feminist geography; France; https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-transport-geography/call-for-papers/critical-vlomobilities; Inclusion; Intersectionality; Mobility; Urban biking","Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Grenoble; Isere; cycle transport; mobility; racism; transportation infrastructure; urban transport","","","","","","","Aldred R., Crosweller S., Investigating the rates and impacts of near misses and related incidents among UK cyclists, J.

These disruptions alter travel dynamics and affect expected travel time and cost, prompting passengers to cancel trips, wait for resolution, or change paths and mode. This paper aims to provide a data-driven methodology for gaining insights into how mode choice is affected by disruptions. First, we use multi-source data to form a unified multi-modal dataset of car, public transport, and bike-sharing demand data. Then, by introducing a signature range, we define an hourly range of expected demand. Utilising this signature range, we first detect hours with irregular demand in each mode and then proceed to spot instances where a potential inter-modal demand spillover has occurred. Finally, exploring our data from Lyon, France, we showcase examples of implementing our method to actual recorded data. Our study paves the way for more extensive studies on the inter-modal demand spillover and its management implications. © 2023 IEEE.","Multimodal mobility; Spillover; Transport disruption; Travel behaviour","Highway accidents; Intelligent systems; Motor transportation; Data-driven analysis; Extreme weather conditions; Multi-modal; Multimodal mobility; Public transport; Signature-based approach; Spillover; Transport disruption; Transport systems; Travel behaviour; Travel time","","","","","MOBITIC, (ANR-19-CE22-0010)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research is supported by the French ANR research projects PROMENADE (grant number ANR-18-CE22-0008) and MOBITIC (grant number ANR-19-CE22-0010).","Timothy F., Welch and Alyas Widita.

This research aims to identify the key components of an economically viable urban network distribution, where inland waterway transport is deployed as the main transport, and cargo bikes or electric vehicles are used for last-mile delivery. The analysis uses a decision-support framework based on a two-echelon city distribution scheme. Numerical experiments are conducted using near-practical instances in France and inputs from industry stakeholders. From the study, it was found that the economic viability of inland waterways as main transport depends on the number of parcels to be delivered, and the existing infrastructures. The city configurations, their accessibility, as well as their operating conditions are also of utmost importance. The lowest CO2 equivalent emissions are obtained by combining inland waterways with electric bikes. This paper can be used as decision-making support and guidance for transport companies, industry stakeholders, and public authorities for an efficient and sustainable urban distribution network combining inland waterways and bikes/vans. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Carbon emissions; Case study; City logistics; Decision-support; Economic cost; Inland waterway transport; Last-mile delivery","","","","","","GeoPoste","This work was supported by a post-doctoral scholarship from GeoPoste.

Looking to the literature, less is known about the acceptance of the other road users (i.e., conventional drivers, cyclists, or pedestrians). Based on social psychology models of acceptance, we study the determinants of the other road users’ acceptance for the implementation of an automated shuttle between Nantes and Carquefou (France). With a sample of 229 participants and using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify the main determinants of the behavioral intention to interact with the automated vehicle.

In this paper we identify the goals that local governments are pursuing when regulating these private services. We also analyse the circumstances and motivations that led to the pursuit of these goals. For this, we carried out three in-depth case studies of cities where private companies had deployed shared mobility services: Bogotá, Colombia; Paris, France; and Los Angeles, USA. We found that there is a wide range of goals (34 distinct goals) that the governments of these cities are pursuing when attempting to regulate shared mobility services. However, only between three and four of these goals tend to dominate most of their actions. We also identified a mix of motivations for the pursuit of these goals: from the public interest of redressing past inequities, to circumstantial motivations such as appeasing the incumbents that have seen their businesses endangered by these new technologies. The academic literature converges on sustainability and equitable access being two of the primary goals to be pursued in transport policy, but our findings suggest that practitioners and policymakers are pursuing a range of other goals that do not fit neatly into these two theoretical categories. © 2024, The Author(s).","Goals; Governance; New mobility; Policy; Shared mobility; Smart mobility","Public policy; Goal; Governance; Government IS; Local government; Mobility service; New mobility; Policy goals; Shared mobility; Smart mobility; Urban mobility; Motivation","","","","","","","Adam B., Groves C., Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics, (2007); AFP.: El Paseo Millonario Atemoriza a Colombia.

The purpose of this study was to define the awareness, prevention and prevalence of this syndrome in licensed motorcycle racers in competition in France. Secondary purposes were to determine the functional impact of CECS and post-treatment outcomes. The 20,641 licensed racers in competition of the French Motorcycle Federation were sent a self-assessment questionnaire about upper limb pain and CECS physical examination findings, functional impact and treatment outcomes. The satisfaction level was assessed after each type of treatment. Acceptability rate was 6.35% with 1311 racers responding. CECS was unknown by 29% of racers. Prevention methods were unknown by 10% of racers. Less than 50% of racers modified their bikes. The prevalence of upper limb CECS in competitive racers was 9%: 8.7% forearm, 0.2% thenar, 0.1% hypothenar and 0.4% first dorsal interosseus compartments. The prevalence was 16% in international level racers, 11% in national level racers and 7.3% in regional level racers. A quarter of racers were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcomes of conservative therapy and rehabilitation. Only 67 racers underwent surgical treatment for their upper limb CECS: 31 by open fasciotomy, 23 by minimally invasive fasciotomy and 13 by endoscopy-assisted compartment release. In these 67 racers, the mean visual analog score for pain improved significantly (p < 0.001 95% CI [3.1–4.5]) with 81% satisfied or very satisfied with surgery outcomes. This epidemiologic self-assessment questionnaire for upper limb CECS is a new concept. This study screened for CECS and offer information regarding evaluation, treatment, and management. © 2021 SFCM","Conservative treatment; Epidemiologic national self-assessment questionnaire; Fasciotomy;

A rank–size law (RSL) is calculated for the team financial gains. The RSL is found to be hyperbolic with a surprisingly simple decay exponent ≈−1. Yet, the financial gain distributions unexpectedly do not obey Pareto principle of factor sparsity. Next, several (8) inequality indices are considered : the Entropy, the Hirschman–Herfindahl, Theil, Pietra–Hoover, Gini, Rosenbluth indices, the Coefficient of Variation and the Concentration Index are calculated for outlining «diversity measures». The connection between such indices and their «concentration aspects» meanings are presented as support of the RSL findings. The results emphasize that the sum of skills and team strategies are effectively contributing to the financial gains distributions. From theoretical and practical points of view, the findings suggest that one should investigate other ”long multiple stage races” and rewarding rules. Indeed, money prize rules coupling to stage difficulty might influence and maybe enhance (or deteriorate) purely sportive aspects in group competitions. Due to the delay in the peer review process, the 2019 results can be examined. They are discussed in an Appendix; the value of the exponent (−1.2) is pointed out to mainly originating from the so called «king effect»; the tail of the RSL rather looks like an exponential. © 2019","Financial gains hierarchy; Financial indices; Professional cyclist multistage races; Rank–size Law; Tour de France","Pareto principle; Sports; Coefficient of variation; Concentration indices; Financial gains; Financial index; Group competitions; Peer-review process; Professional cyclists; Tour de France; Finance","","","","","","","Gini C., Measurement of inequality of incomes, Econom.

However, the underlying optimization problem for this service is highly complex. One of the most critical challenges when solving the problem is solution quality and computation time, especially in large-scale problems where the number of received requests is huge. In this paper, we rely on an exact solving method to ensure the quality of the solution, while using AI-based techniques to limit the number of requests that we feed to the solver. More precisely, we propose a clustering method based on a new shareability function to put the most shareable trips inside separate clusters. Previous studies only consider Spatio-temporal dependencies to do clustering on the mobility service requests, which is not efficient in finding the shareable trips. Here, we define the shareability function to consider all the different sharing states for each pair of trips. Each cluster is then managed with a proposed heuristic framework in order to solve the matching problem inside each cluster. As the method favors sharing, we present the number of sharing constraints to allow the service to choose the number of shared trips. To validate our proposal, we employ the proposed method on the network of Lyon city in France, with half-million requests in the morning peak from 6 to 10 AM. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can provide high-quality solutions in a short time for large-scale problems. The proposed clustering method can also be used for different mobility service problems such as car-sharing, bike-sharing, etc. © 2022 Alisoltani et al.

The aim of this study is to estimate bicycle collisions and falls' rates on bicycle facilities in Lyon (France). This study uses data from a survey of regular cyclists that collected information regarding crash history as well as their regular routes. A sample of 780 regular cyclists' routes was analyzed. Bicycle crash data (n=274) and cyclist exposure (n=764 633 km) were collected for 2 years to calculate relative event rate (collision, fall and injury rates). Relative rates of collision on bicycle facilities are significantly higher than on road. Differences for fall rates are not significant, except for contraflow cycle lane which seems unsafe. Relative rates of injury suggest that travelling on bicycle facilities is not necessarily safer than on the road. Results provide some evidence for cycle facilities design and planning. © 2023 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.

Yet knowledge about the characteristics and the activity patterns of delivery couriers is scarce, especially in terms of their mobility behavior. Methodology: Based on two questionnaire surveys conducted in 2020 and 2021 with 300 and 500 couriers respectively, this article analyses the profiles, motivations and mobility patterns of couriers working in Paris (France), with a focus on the impacts of the pandemic. Results: First, the analysis of the profiles and motivations of couriers reveals that platform-based delivery is largely a temporary activity performed by young males of foreign origin, and undertaken as a student job or an entry to the labor market. Second, data on mobility patterns confirm that platform-based delivery is a dangerous activity with a high risk of road accidents. Moreover, many couriers break the law in order to increase their income by using motorized two-wheelers that are not legally permitted in France. We also show the use of shared bikes, which seems to be a great support tool for couriers who are starting work in this sector or have a problem with their own bikes. Third, the pandemic prompted many students to become platform-based delivery couriers in order to compensate for the lack of student jobs. It also worsened the working conditions of the majority of platform-based couriers. These findings raise new urban policy challenges and also new avenues for research in terms of topics and methods. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accidents; Bikes; Couriers; Delivery; Platforms; Shared mobility; Street survey","Accidents; Bicycles; Students; Surveys; Activity patterns; Bike; Courier; Delivery; Food delivery; Food sector; Mobility pattern; Platform; Shared mobility; Street survey; Motivation","","","","","City Logistics Research Chair; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Ministère de la Transition écologique et Solidaire, MTES","This research was funded by the DGITM from the French Ministry of Ecological and Solidarity Transition (MTES), the French National Research Agency (ANR), and the City Logistics Research Chair.

Identifying effectiveness-critical AEB–cyclist design parameters through a sensitivity analysis was also targeted. Methods: The analysis is based on a representative set of real-world car-to-cyclist frontal collisions gathered from French police reports. AEB–cyclist-relevant accident cases were first selected and used to build injury risk curves for fatal, severe, and slight cyclist injuries. The effect of AEB–cyclist on these cases was then simulated by means of a car kinematic model involving sensor detection strategies and actuator actions. Combining the resulting simulated impact speed distributions with the injury risk curves allowed to assess AEB–cyclist’s effectiveness in terms of lives saved and mitigated injuries. Using design of experiments methods, the sensitivity of this effectiveness with regards to AEB–cyclist design parameters could be assessed. Results: Cyclist injury risks curves were built, along with their confidence intervals, for fatal, severe, and slight injuries using a polytomous complementary log–log regression model, with squared impact speed as an independent variable. A sensitivity analysis on an ideal bisensor AEB–cyclist setting highlighted influential design parameters such as maximal braking intensity or crucial decision algorithm parameters such as maximal time and distance to collision thresholds. AEB–cyclist effectiveness was nevertheless shown to range from 35% to 59% in fatalities, 14% to 54% in severe injuries, and 11% to 42% in slight injuries, depending on field of view parameters alone, once reference values of decision algorithm parameters had been set. Conclusions: This study illustrates the potential benefits and limits of AEB–cyclist systems. High-end systems show acceptable effectiveness rates, but road safety performance strongly depends on external factors such as road surface conditions or has to be tuned in order to avoid unnecessary activations and driver discomfort. Limits of the system’s everyday use (lack of maintenance, driver reaction time to collision warnings, etc.) were not taken into account, thus resulting in optimistic evaluations of AEB–cyclist effectiveness. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","active safety; AEB; cyclist; effectiveness; injury risk curve; sensitivity analysis","Accidents, Traffic; Algorithms; Automobiles; Bicycling; Data Collection; Deceleration; Emergencies; France; Humans; Police; Prospective Studies; Protective Devices; Wounds and Injuries; algorithm; car; cycling; deceleration; emergency; France; human; information processing; injury; police; prospective study; protective equipment; traffic accident","","","","","","","Amoros E., Et al., (2015); Cuny S., Chajmowicz H., Yong K., Hermitte T., Lecuyer E., Bertholon N., A tool to assess pedestrian safety: risk curves by injury severity and their confidence intervals for car-to-pedestrian front collision, Paper presented at: International Research Council on the biomechanics of injury (IRCOBI), (2018); Edwards M., Nathanson A., Wisch M., Estimate of potential benefit for Europe of fitting autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems for pedestrian protection to passenger cars, Traffic Inj Prev, 15, sup1, pp. S173-S182, (2014); Efron B., Tibshirani R.J., Bootstrap methods for standard errors, confidence intervals and other measures of statistical accuracy, Statist Sci, 1, 1, pp. 54-77, (1986); (2018); Karna K., Sahai R., An overview on Taguchi method, Int J Eng Mat Sci, 1, pp. 11-18, (2012); Lesire P., Et al., Implication of children in road accidents in France in 2011, (2015); Liers H., Spitzhuttl F., Methods for the creation of injury risk functions based on real-world accident data, (2016); Lindman M., Et al., Benefit Estimation Model for Pedestrian Auto Brake Functionality.

This situation is particularly important in the last-mile urban distribution in city centers due to the fact that private cars, public transportation, and freight transportation fiery compete for the same space. This article contextualizes this phenomenon in two European medium-size cities: Angers (France) and Pamplona (Spain). The paper also draws the current situation regarding their mobility and freight-delivery systems in their city centers. Thus, an apposite survey has been deployed in both cities in order to collect social perceptions and mobility patterns data. Additionally, we have included a conjoint analysis study for examining the characteristic determinants for aerial (drone) distribution. Likewise, meaningful conclusions can be extracted from the analysis of the results generated by the current analysis. Firstly, we have realized the immediate effects of a recent sustainable urban-mobility plan at Pamplona, which contrasts with the Angers case, where no similar plan has been deployed yet. Secondly, we have focused our attention on the socio-economic factors that determine the mobility in both cities. Thirdly, we have observed, in both cities, a clear preference for electric vehicles and cargo-bikes for driving inside the city center. Finally, there is a rejection to use drones for merchandise delivery. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

It remains unknown, however, if an average recreational athlete could endure such an event. Through the analysis of power output (PO), we compared data from the 2023 Tour de France (21 stages, total distance ¼ 3,405 km, elevation gain ¼ 51,815 m) in a recreational (male, age ¼ 58 yr; height ¼ 191 cm; body mass ¼ 96.1 kg; estimated maximum oxygen uptake ¼ 45.4 mL·kg¯1·min¯1) and a sex-matched professional (World-Tour) cyclist (28 yr; 180 cm; 67.0 kg; 80.5 mL·kg¯1·min¯1). The recreational and professional cyclist completed the event in 191 and 87 h, respectively (average PO of 1.50 and 3.45 W·kg¯1), with the latter spending a greater proportion of time in high-intensity zones. The recreational cyclist showed an estimated total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) of 35.9 MJ [or 8,580 kcal, or ~4.3 his daily basal metabolic rate (BMR)], whereas lower absolute values were estimated for the professional cyclist (29.7 MJ, 7,098 kcal, ~3.8˟ his BMR). Despite such high TDEE values, both individuals lost minimal body mass during the event (0–2 kg). The present report therefore suggests that, partly due to differences in exercise intensity and duration, not only professional cyclists but also recreational athletes can reach currently known ceilings of TDEE for humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This case report indicates that a recreationally trained 58-year-old man can reach similar or even higher values of energy expenditure (~4 times their basal metabolic rate) than professional cyclists, who are likely near the ceiling of sustained energy expenditure for humans.

Methods After body composition assessment (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), two submaximal cycling step tests were performed in ambient (20°C, 40%) and hot and humid (30°C, 60% [HH]) conditions from which measures of gross efficiency (GE), lactate-power landmarks, and heart rate responses were calculated. In addition, thermoregulatory and sweat responses were collected throughout. V-O 2peak and peak power output (PPO) were also identified after a separate ramp test to exhaustion. Results V-O 2peak and PPO were 5.91 L·min -1 (84 mL·kg -1 ·min -1) and 525 W, respectively, whereas mean GE values were 23.0% and 23.6% for ambient and HH conditions, respectively. In addition to superior GE, power output at 4 mmol·L -1 lactate was higher in HH versus ambient conditions (429.6 vs 419.0 W) supporting anecdotal reports from the participant of good performance in the heat. Peak core and skin temperature, sweat rate, and electrolyte content were higher in HH conditions. Body fat percentage was 9.5%, whereas total fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral content were 6.7, 61.5, and 2.8 kg, respectively. Conclusion The aerobic physiology and PPO values indentified are among the highest reported for professional road cyclists. Notably, the participant displayed both a high V-O 2peak and GE, which is uncommon among elite cyclists and may be a contributing factor to their success in elite cycling. In addition, performance in HH conditions was strong, suggesting effective thermoregulatory physiology. In summary, this is the first study to report physiological characteristics of a multiple Tour de France champion in close to peak condition and suggests what may be the prerequisite physiological and thermoregulatory capacities for success at this level.

Purpose: This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of the Keo power pedals during several laboratory cycling tasks. Methods: Ten active male participants (mean ± SD age 34.0 ± 10.6 y, height 1.77 ± 0.04 m, body mass 76.5 ± 10.7 kg) familiar with laboratory cycling protocols completed this study. Each participant was required to complete 2 laboratory cycling trials on an SRM ergometer (SRM, Germany) that was also fitted with the Keo power pedals (Look, France). The trials consisted of an incremental test to exhaustion followed by 10 min rest and then three 10-s sprint tests separated by 3 min of cycling at 100 W. Results: Over power ranges of 75 to 1147 W, the Keo power-pedal system produced typical error values of 0.40, 0.21, and 0.21 for the incremental, sprint, and combined trials, respectively, compared with the SRM. Mean differences of 21.0 and 18.6 W were observed between trials 1 and 2 with the Keo system in the incremental and combined protocols, respectively. In contrast, the SRM produced differences of 1.3 and 0.6 W for the same protocols. Conclusions: The power data from the Keo power pedals should be treated with some caution given the presence of mean differences between them and the SRM. Furthermore, this is exacerbated by poorer reliability than that of the SRM power meter. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Ergometer; Intermittent; Power meter; Road cycling","Adult; Bicycling; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Equipment Design; Exercise Test; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult; adult; cost benefit analysis; cycling; devices; economics; equipment design; exercise test; human; male; muscle strength; physiology; reproducibility; validation study; young adult","","","","","","","Jobson S.A., Passfield L., Atkinson G., Barton G., Scarf P., The analysis and utilization of cycling training data, Sports Med, 39, 10, pp. 833-844, (2009); Vogt S., Heinrich L., Schumacher Y.O., Et al., Power output during stage racing in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 38, 1, pp. 147-151, (2006); Pinot J., Grappe F., The record power profile to assess performance in elite cyclists, Int J Sports Med, 32, pp. 839-844, (2011); Bertucci W., Duc S., Villerius V., Grappe F., Validity and reliability of the Axiom Powertrain cycle ergometer when compared with an SRM powermeter, Int J Sports Med, 26, pp. 59-65, (2005); Bertucci W., Duc S., Villerius V., Pernin J.N., Grappe F., Validity and reliability of the Powertap mobile cycling powermeter when compared with the SRM device, Int J Sports Med, 26, pp. 868-873, (2005); Gordon R.S., Franklin K.L., Davies B., Baker J.S., Further mechanical considerations between Polar and SRM mobile ergometer systems during laboratory-based high-intensity, intermittent cycling activity, Res Sports Med, 15, pp. 241-247, (2007); Millet G.P., Tronche C., Fuster N., Bentley D.J., Candau R., Validity and reliability of the Polar S710 mobile cycling powermeter, Int J Sports Med, 24, pp. 156-161, (2003); Duc S., Villerius V., Bertucci W., Grappe F., Validity and reproducibility of the Ergmo®Pro power meter compared with the SRM and Powertap power meters, Int J Sports Physiol Perform, 2, 3, pp. 270-281, (2007); Souissi N., Driss T., Chamari K., Et al., Diurnal variation in Wingate test performances: Influence of active warm-up, Chronobiol Int, 27, 3, pp. 640-652, (2010); Smith J.C., Hill D.W., Contribution of energy systems during a Wingate power test, Br J Sports Med, 25, 4, pp. 196-199, (1991); Grafen A., Hails R., Modern Statistics for the Life Sciences, (2002); Atkinson G., Nevill A.M., Statistical methods for assessing measurement error (reliability) in variables relevant to sports medicine, Sports Med, 26, 4, pp. 217-238, (1998); Hopkins W.G., Analysis of reliability with a spreadsheet (beta version), Sportscience, (2012); Hopkins W.G., Analysis of validity by linear regression (Excel spreadsheet), Sportscience, (2012); Bland J.M., Altman D.G., Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement, Lancet, 1, 8476, pp. 307-310, (1986); Hopkins W.G., Measures of reliability in sports medicine and science, Sports Med, 30, 1, pp. 1-15, (2000); Chiementin X., Crequy S., Bertucci W., Validity and reliability of the G-Cog device for kinematic measurements, Int J Sports Med, 34, 11, pp. 945-949, (2013); Doherty M., Balmer J., Davison R.C.R., Robinson L., Smith P.M., Reliability of a combined 3-min constant load and performance cycling test, Int J Sports Med, 24, pp. 366-371, (2003); Paton C.D., Hopkins W.G., Tests of cycling performance, Sports Med, 31, 7, pp. 489-496, (2001); Capriotti P.V., Sherman W.M., Lamb D.R., Reliability of power output during intermittent high intensity cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 31, 6, pp. 913-915, (1999); Abbiss C.R., Levin G., McGuigan M.R., Laursen P.B., Reliability of power output during dynamic cycling, Int J Sports Med, 29, pp. 574-578, (2008); Zabala M., Peinado A.B., Calderon F.J., Sampedro J., Castillo M.J., Benito P.J., Bicarbonate ingestion has no ergogenic effect on consecutive all out sprint tests in BMX elite cyclists, Eur J Appl Physiol, 111, 12, pp. 3127-3134, (2011); Watt K.K.O., Hopkins W.G., Snow R.J., Reliability of performance in repeated sprint cycling tests, J Sci Med Sport, 5, 4, pp. 354-361, (2002); Hayes M., Smith D., Castle P.C., Watt P.W., Ross E.Z., Maxwell N.S., Peak power output provides the most reliable measure of performance in prolonged intermittent-sprint cycling, J Sports Sci, 31, 5, pp. 565-572, (2013)","","","Human Kinetics Publishers Inc.","","","","","","15550265","","","24896154","English","Int.

The book analyses the individual visions of the heroic Pyrenees which in turn fascinated 19th-century mountaineers and the racing cyclists of the early Tour de France. Martyn Lyons also investigates the role of the Pyrenees during the Second World War as an escape route from Nazi-occupied France, when for thousands of refugees these dangerous borderlands became ‘the mountains of liberty’, and considers the place of the Pyrenees in recent times right up to the present day. Drawing on travel writing, press reports and scientific texts in several languages, The Pyrenees in the Modern Era explores both the French and Spanish sides of the Pyrenees to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the cultural construction of one of Europe’s most prominent border regions. This book will be of great interest to scholars and students of Europe’s cultural history in a transnational context. © Martyn Lyons, 2018.","","","","","","","","","Associació d’Excursions Catalana, Butlettí mensual, (1878);

The diabetes world has also been affected by this increased interest and there is now a vast number of cycling events promoted through diabetes charities, in addition to professional and developmental cycling teams consisting entirely of individuals with diabetes. This article focuses on the early stages of getting started with cycling participation; it also discusses the benefits to health and the environment, guidelines on how much physical activity to do, current participation levels, and strategies to get started with cycling and maintain this new behaviour over the longer term.

These coefficients were calculated within national/regional studies in the examined countries, through a specially developed uniform methodology of linking and matching Police road accident records and hospital records. Log-rate models are developed in order to estimate the combined effects of country (CZ, FR, GR, HU, NL, ES and the UK), road user type (car occupant, motorcyclist, pedal cyclist, pedestrian), Police severity score (serious or slight injury) and MAIS score (the maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale score) on under-reporting.; Results: The results suggest that the examined characteristics have important combined effect on under-reporting (i.e. third-order interaction). The results of the analysis of lower-order interactions reveal specific particularities of each country/region, indicating areas on which authorities should focus their efforts.; Conclusions: For example, it was found that slight injuries are more likely to be under-reported than serious injuries in the Czech Republic, France, and Greece, while the opposite is the case for the Netherlands and the UK. Moreover, although the Netherlands do not present high under-reporting rates overall, a particular issue is identified in this country for pedal cyclists’ slight injuries. Finally, a considerable part of total under-reporting in most countries can be attributed to injury severity mis-reporting. © 2014, The Author(s).","Injury severity; Log-rate analysis; Road accident injury; Under-reporting","Accidents; Law enforcement; Roads and streets; Abbreviated injury scale; European Countries; Injury severity; Rate analysis; Related injuries; Road accident injuries; Serious injuries; Under-reporting; Motor transportation","","","","","European Commission, EC; Sixth Framework Programme, FP6","Acknowledgments Part of this research was co-financed by the European Commission, within the SafetyNet Integrated Project of the 6th Framework Programme.","Amoros E., Martin J.L., Laumon B., Under-reporting of road crash casualties in France, Accid Anal Prev, 38, pp. 627-635, (2006); Aptel I., Salmi L.R., Masson F., Bourde A., Henrion G., Erny P., Road accident statistics: discrepancies between police and hospital data in a French island, Accid Anal Prev, 31, pp. 101-108, (1999); Alsop J., Langley J., Under-reporting of motor vehicle traffic crash victims in New Zealand, Accid Anal Prev, 33, pp. 353-359, (2001); Brenner H., Application of capture–recapture methods for disease monitoring: potential effects of imperfect record linkage, Methods Inf Med, 33, 5, pp. 502-506, (1994); Broughton J., Amoros E., Bos N., Evgenikos P., Hollo P., Perez C., Tecl J., Estimating the real number of road accident casualties.

As an example, almost 100% of reclaimed asphalt pavement is recycled and used in pavement construction. In fact the amount of recycled asphalt pavement used exceeds that of glass, paper, aluminum and plastic combined. Warm mix asphalt represents another advancement with significant environmental advantages, such as reduced fossil fuel costs and less emissions. More recently, two pavement technologies have come to the forefront; permeable pavements and solar pavements. Permeable pavements offer an enhanced method for managing stormwater. These pavements, generally used for parking lots or other low traffic applications, allow stormwater to drain through the pavement surface into a stone recharge bed (or reservoir) and infiltrate into the soils below the pavement. The surface of a permeable pavement can be specially designed asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete, or permeable pavers. Advantages include purifying stormwater runoff, and replenishing water tables and aquifers rather than forcing rainfall into storm sewers. Solar pavements are even a more recent environmental development. Solar pavements (or surfacing) is a modular system of specially engineered solar panels that can be walked and driven upon. In some cases the panels contain LED lights to create lines and signage without paint. They can contain heating elements to prevent snow and ice accumulation. The Netherlands built the first solar road, a bike path, in 2014. France announced a bolder move recently that over the next five years, it plans to install 1,000 kilometres of solar roads. Installations in North America are likely “just around the corner”. This paper will have the objective of providing a fair, but critical review of these two pavement technologies, specific to the Canadian context. There can be no denying that these innovations have a significant environmental upside; but does that upside come at a cost, a cost that may or may not make good sense?

It is hence relevant to improve the knowledge of the injury risk associated with cycling, compared with other means of transport such as car, walking and powered two-wheeler (PTW) riding. Methods The injury incidence rates were estimated by the ratio between accident data and mobility (exposure) data. Two accident data sources were used: police data and hospital-based data (outpatients and inpatients) from the Rhône road trauma Registry. This provides four injury categories: all-injury, hospitalization, serious-injury and fatal-injury. Exposure data were estimated from a regional household travel survey (RTS), using three measures of mobility: number of trips, distance traveled and time spent traveling. The survey was carried out from November 2005 to April 2006, on weekdays, outside school and public holidays; this seasonality was corrected using the 2007-2008 national household travel survey (NTS) that covered an entire year. Only information involving accidents and trips in, and residents of, the Rhône County (1.6 million inhabitants, including the city Lyon) were included in our study. Trends of injury rates were also evaluated in Greater Lyon, using previous travel surveys. Results The PTW riders had the highest all-injury, hospitalization, serious-injury and fatal-injury rates, followed by cyclists, and lastly by pedestrians and car occupants. The rates between men and women seemed similar among pedestrians and among car occupants. For car occupants, pedestrians and cyclists, the age group 18-25 years had higher all-injury rate compared with the age group 25-65 years. On the contrary, the age group ≥65 years seemed to have higher hospitalization and serious-injury rates, compared with the age group 25-65 years. For cyclists, the injury rates seemed higher in non-dense areas than in dense areas. Between 1996-1997 and 2005-2006 and with regards to time spent traveling, the all-injury, serious-injury and fatal-injury rates seemed to have decreased for car occupants and cyclists. Conclusion The higher risk for PTW riders is confirmed and quantified; it is very high. Decrease in injury rates seems more marked for cyclists; this may indicate the ""safety in numbers"" effect. Countermeasures for improving road safety could be implemented, especially for vulnerable road user types. However, they will not be sufficient to fill in the gap between the much higher risk for PTW riders and that of car occupants. Exposure-based injury rates can be a tool for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of policies and programs, and for comparisons between countries. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Ten female cyclists volunteered to participate in the study. HRV was recorded with a portable heart rate monitor each morning at rest in supine (7 min.) and upright (7 min.) positions, as well as throughout each day’s stage. Pre-Tour baseline HRV recordings were made, as well as during the four weeks following completion of the Tour. Exercise daily load was assessed using the training impulse score (TRIMPS). Post-exercise rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed daily using the Borg CR-10 scale. Results The results show a HRV imbalance, increase of sympathetic and decrease of vagal activities respectively, along the event that correlated with rate of perceived exertion (r = 0.46), training impulse score (r = 0.60), and kilometers (r = 046). The greatest change in HRV balance was observed the days after the greatest relative physical load. Mean heart rate and heart rate variability values returned to their baseline values one week after completion of the event. Conclusions Despite incomplete recovery from day-to-day, fatigue is not summative or augmented with each successive stage and its physical load. Just one week is sufficient to restore baseline values. Heart rate and HRV can be used as a tool to strategically plan the effort of female cyclists that participate in multi-stage events. © 2019 Barrero et al.

The main aim of this centre is to lead the way in the design, implementation, and evaluation of multilevel PA interventions to improve their efficacy and sustainability inside the city. CAPAS-City responds to the main challenges related to multilevel PA interventions, through six guiding principles: (1) promoting sustainability, (2) playing a leadership role, (3) promoting multisectoral partnerships, (4) using evidence-based strategies, (5) promoting integrated knowledge translation, and (6) using a participatory research approach. Five multilevel PA interventions were designed in both cities by CAPAS-City with these principles in mind. Through the example of the Annual MOT Test adapted to bikes, we also illustrate one practical application of the use of these principles, following the Social-Ecological approach, in which the main agents of influence are involved at different levels to encourage cycling. According to the promising results found in this study, CAPAS-City appears to be a structure that is able to respond to the main needs and challenges of multilevel interventions to increase PA levels in the whole population of both cities. © 2019 by the authors.","Active commuting; Disadvantaged populations; Health; Leadership; Multilevel; Partnerships; Physical activity; Social-ecological model; Stakeholders","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Community-Based Participatory Research; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Evidence-Based Practice; Exercise; Female; Follow-Up Studies; France; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Leadership; Male; Middle Aged; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Social Environment; Spain; Stakeholder Participation; Translational Medical Research; Urban Health; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult; Aragon; France; Huesca [Aragon]; Huesca [Huesca (PRV)]; Spain; commuting; cycle transport; health status; leadership; participatory approach; physical activity; stakeholder; sustainability; article; city; comparative effectiveness; France; human; leadership; participatory research; physical activity; Spain; adolescent; adult; child; cultural factor; evidence based practice; exercise; female; follow up; health behavior; health promotion; leadership; male; middle aged; organization and management; procedures; program development; program evaluation; social environment; stakeholder engagement; translational research; urban health; vulnerable population; young adult","","","","","CAPAS-City; Centre for the Promotion of Physical Activity and Health, (I-2016/013); European Funding for regional development; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER, (POCTEFA 2014-2020); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","Funding text 1: This study was funded up to 65% by the European Funding for regional development (FEDER) through Interreg V-A Spain, France, Andorra (POCTEFA 2014-2020) through CAPAS-City (Centre for the Promotion of Physical Activity and Health) (I-2016/013).; Funding text 2: CAPAS-City was funded by the European programme for territorial cooperation and sustainable development of cross-border regions (Spain, France, and Andorra in this case) called POCTEFA 2014–2020.

However, national actors and sensitivities always remained present. In interaction with these transnational flows they shaped national identity in this sport, as the Belgian case shows. Belgium was a site of cross-border interaction for racing from early on. Nevertheless, actors like the Belgian cycling press or national cycling union also continuously tried to construct a national racing culture. French and British influences were especially crucial here, as Belgian actors were continuously torn between both in determining their position in the amateur-professional question or in the International Cycling Association. France and Britain thus functioned as significant others in the shaping of national Belgian racing, a process often complicated by the transnational activities of other, commercially motivated actors like cycling tracks or racers themselves. In competition, too, the discourses of the Belgian press on racers Hubert Houben and Robert Protin celebrated their small nation and its success against and differences from its bigger neighbours. The Belgian orientation on French racing eventually became dominant, and proved to be crucial to the resurrection of the sport in Belgium after a period of crisis around 1900. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","cycling; Emile de Beukelaer; internationalism; nationalism; Union Cycliste Internationale","","","","","","","","Ameye T., Bieke G., Delheye P., Daredevils and early birds: Belgian pioneers in automobile racing and aerial sports during the belle e ́ poque, International Journal of the History of Sport, 28, 2, pp. 205-223, (2011); Bairner A., Sport Nationalism and Globalization: European and North American Perspectives, (2001); Bender T., Rethinking American History in A Global Age, (2002); Bijker W.E., Of Bicycles Bakelites and Bulbs.

Being a top destination in European city tourism, the French capital provides an excellent opportunity to study the particular role of tourism in urban transformations. Based on substantial exploratory fieldwork that was carried out between 2013 and 2016, we argue that Paris is subject to on-going dynamics of touristification that are particularly intense at the margins of the existing tourist hot spots. First, we identify relevant tourist areas using GPS tracking technology and field observation techniques. Second, we discuss the role of Airbnb in the emerging touristification of widely gentrified residential neighborhoods. Third, we reflect on the urban mobility practices of cyclists and pedestrians which have the potential to foster touristification by interconnecting various tourist hotspots and accommodation locations. We suggest that the current urban transformations should primarily be seen as a bottom-up initiative that involves both tourists and residents in the city. Considering tourism growth and urban transformations as mutually constitutive processes, we conclude with a consideration of potential future developments in Paris. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Airbnb; mobility; Paris; tourist practices; touristification; Urban tourism; urban transformation","France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; bottom-up approach; mobility; neighborhood; tourism; tourist destination; urban development","","","","","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst France, (55925893); Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst France","This work was generously supported by the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst [grant number 55925893].","Ashworth G., Page S.J., Urban tourism research: Recent progress and current paradoxes, Tourism Management,, 32, 1, pp. 1-15, (2011); Auge M., Un ethnologue dans le métro, (1986); Baerenholdt J.O., Haldrup M., Larsen J., Urry J., Performing tourist places, (2004); Bauder M., Using GPS supported speed analysis to determine spatial visitor behaviour, International Journal of Tourism Research,, 17, 4, pp. 337-346, (2015); Bauder M., Refining the Central Tourist District of Paris with GPS tracking data and GIS analysis, Via@ International Interdisciplinary Review of Tourism, (2015); Bauder M., Freytag T., Gerardot M., Exploring tourist mobility in Paris.

Method: Data come from a French project on road crashes, which include all fatal road crashes and a random sample of 1/20th of nonfatal crashes in France in 2011, based on police reports. A case–control study was carried out on a sample of 903 crashes for 444 LOC motorcycle riders (case) and 470 non-LOC and nonresponsible motorcycle riders (control). The sample was weighted due to the randomization of nonfatal crashes. Missing values were imputed using multiple imputation. Results: Road alignment and surface conditions, human factors, and motorcycle type played important roles in motorcycle LOC crashes. Riding in a curve was associated with a 3-fold greater risk of losing control of motorcycle than riding in a straight line. Poor road adhesion significantly increased the risk of losing control; the risk increased more than 20-fold when deteriorated road adhesion was encountered unexpectedly, due to loose gravel, ice, oil, bumps, road marking, metal plates, etc. For motorcyclists, riding with a positive blood alcohol concentration (over or equal to the legal limit of 0.5 g/L) was very dangerous, often resulting in losing control. The risk of LOC crash varied for different types of motorcycle: Riders of roadsters and sports bikes were more likely to have an LOC crash greater than that of riders of basic or touring motorcycles. In addition, LOC risk increased with speed; a model using the square of the traveling speed showed better fit than one using speed itself. Conclusion: The LOC crash factors related to riders, vehicles, and road infrastructure identified here were expected but were rarely identified and taken simultaneously into account in previous studies. They could be targeted by countermeasures to improve motorcyclist safety. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","curve; LOC; Motorcycle; motorcycle type; road adhesion; traveling speed","Accidents, Traffic;

On the one hand, the first sports federations were created and started organizing regulated competitions. On the other, sport was at the crossroads of public performance, technological development and bourgeois sociability typical of the end of the nineteenth century. Our aim is to understand the place and forms of sport in society concentrating on the city of Paris. This work focuses on the analysis of several photo reports done by Jules Beau, one of the first sport reporters in France. Following the steps of this man, a Parisian, member of the Touring Club de France and a cycling enthusiast, provides an original perspective–obviously limited by the constraints of a monographic work–on the sports phenomenon between 1894 and 1913, the period during which he carried out this specific activity. The corpus of this study comprises 36 volumes of nearly 6,000 photographs. Even though portraits of cyclists represent a large part of the corpus, this analysis concentrates on the photographic reports made by Jules Beau when covering the sports events offered to the Parisians of the time. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aviation; car racing; cycling; Paris; Sports photography","","","","","","","","","P.-O.

Although the current title-holder is not a native Kenyan, some believe that the multiday stage race will one day be won by a cyclist with East-African roots. In 2015, the world got a glimpse of what might become a common sight in future editions of the Tour. The latest edition of the event introduced MTN-Qhubeka (currently known as Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka) as its first professional African cycling team ever to participate. The team's Eritrean cyclist Daniel Teklehaimanot exceeded all expectations by becoming the first native African to win the King of the Mountains classification of Critérium du Dauphiné, as well as by claiming the polka dot jersey in the early stages of the tour a few weeks later. But are riders such as Daniel Teklehaimanot and his Rwandan team-mate Adrien Niyonshuti the first of many native Africans who will soon be dominating professional road cycling? Besides the fact that most African countries lack a well-embedded cycling culture, with the exception of Daniel Teklehaimanot's Eritrea, do native African cyclists have what it takes to become elite cyclists? To the best of our knowledge, no data have yet been published on the performance capacity of African cyclists. This report presents unique performance data collected from four cyclists from the National Road Cycling Team of Rwanda.","Athlete; Endurance; Performance","Anthropometry; Athletic Performance; Bicycling; Competitive Behavior; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Rwanda; Young Adult; anthropometry; athletic performance; competitive behavior; cycling; human; male; oxygen consumption; Rwanda; young adult","","","","","","","Kuipers H., Verstappen F.T., Keizer H.A., Et al., Variability of aerobic performance in the laboratory and its physiologic correlates, IntJ Sports Med, 6, pp. 197-201, (1985); Lucia A., Hoyos J., Chicharro J.L., Physiology of professional road cycling, Sports Med, 31, pp. 325-337, (2001); Scott R.A., Pitsiladis Y.P., Genotypes and distance running: Clues from Africa, Sports Med, 37, pp. 424-427, (2007); Wilber R.L., Pitsiladis Y.P., Kenyan and Ethiopian distance runners: What makes them so good?, Int J Sports Physiol Perform, 7, pp. 92-102, (2012); Van Zuydam J., Patricios J., African cycling: Dormant to dominant?, Br J Sports Med, 49, pp. 965-966, (2015); Wilber R.L., Stray-Gundersen J., Levine B.D., Effect of hypoxic ""dose"" on physiological responses and sea-level performance, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 39, pp. 1590-1599, (2007); Moore R., The Hardest Road, Secondary the Hardest Road., (2015); Padilla S., Mujika I., Cuesta G., Et al., Level ground and uphill cycling ability in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 31, pp. 878-885, (1999)","L.J.C.

Where most studies view unethical behavior as something that is identifiable per se, the authors of the present article believe that it only exists because it has been constructed by people operating within a specific context. Hence the efforts made by this paper to explore, at the level of one specific organization, how interactions between employees and consumers might lead to the construct of unethical consumers. Based on a case study of France’s AMDM—a mutual insurance company set up to serve a client base comprising motorcyclists—the paper addresses how one group of consumers ends up being categorized as unethical by revealing the existence of a sensemaking process within the target organization. This process develops in three main phases: the nurturing of a shared ethos; the protection of employees’ recognized status; and the demonization of any group of consumers threatening this status. Managers incorporating this sensemaking process can avoid or mitigate the negative effects befalling organizations when these kinds of unethical consumer behavior are constructed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biker; Demonization; Ethos; Insurance; Recognition; Scooterist; Sensemaking","","","","","","","","Adkins N.R., Ozanne J.L., The low literate consumer, Journal of Consumer Research, 32, 1, pp. 93-105, (2005); Alvesson M., Organizations as rhetoric: Knowledge-intensive firms and the struggle with ambiguity, Journal of Management Studies, 30, 6, pp. 997-1015, (1993); Arnould E.J., Cayla J., Consumer fetish: Commercial ethnography and the sovereign consumer, Organization Studies, 36, 10, pp. 1361-1386, (2015); Arnould E.J., Rose A.S., Mutuality critique and substitute for Belk’s “sharing, Marketing Theory, (2015); Babakus E., Cornwell T.B., Mitchell V., Schlegelmilch B., Reactions to unethical consumer behavior across six countries, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 21, 4, pp. 254-263, (2004); Becker H.S., Outsiders: Studies in the sociology of deviance, (1963); Belk R.W., Handbook of qualitative research methods in marketing, (2007); Belk R.W., Devinney T., Eckhardt G., Consumer ethics across cultures, Consumption Markets & Culture, 8, 3, pp. 275-289, (2005); Berry L.L., Seiders K., Serving unfair customers, Business Horizons, 51, 1, pp. 29-37, (2008); Boltanski L., Thevenot L., On justification: Economies of worth, (2006); Clegg S., Kornberger M., Rhodes C., Business ethics as practice, British Journal of Management, 18, 2, pp. 107-122, (2007); Corsaro D., Snehota I., Alignment and misalignment in business relationships, Industrial Marketing Management, 40, 6, pp. 1042-1054, (2011); Cova B., Community of consumption: Towards a definition of the “linking value” of products or services, European Journal of Marketing, 31, 3-4, pp. 297-316, (1997); Consumer Tribes, (2007); D'Astous A., Legendre A., Understanding consumers’ ethical justifications: A scale for appraising consumers’ reasons for not behaving ethically, Journal of Business Ethics, 87, 2, pp. 255-268, (2009); De Laine M., Fieldwork, participation and practice.

In order to meet the users' demands, bicycle sharing systems must be rebalanced regularly. The problem is to design (near-) optimal vehicles routes to visit and rebalance the stations so as to minimize the number of users who try to collect bikes from empty stations or to deliver bikes to full stations. This paper deals with the vehicles routing problem in the dynamic case by extending our previous work based on stochastic Petri net model coupled with a genetic algorithm. We consider the minimization of the uncomfortable situations overall network stations and the total operational cost simultaneously. The proposed simulation-optimization method is tested on a large set of instances and then applied to Cristolib, a real self-service bicycle system of Creteil city, France. © 2015 EUROSIS-ETI.","Bicycle sharing systems;

Experiments were designed to explore the influence of wind speed and steepness of climb on accuracy of Pest. The authors hypothesized that the random error in Pest would be largely influenced by the windy conditions, the bias would be diminished in steeper climbs, and windy conditions would induce larger bias in Pest. Methods: Sixteen well-trained cyclists performed 15 uphill-cycling trials (range: length 1.3-6.3 km, slope 4.4-10.7%) in a random order. Trials included different riding position in a group (lead or follow) and different wind speeds. Pmes was quantified using a power meter, and Pest was calculated with a methodology used by journalists reporting on the Tour de France. Results: Overall, the difference between Pmes and P est was -0.95% (95%CI: -10.4%, +8.5%) for all trials and 0.24% (-6.1%, +6.6%) in conditions without wind (2 m/s). The relationship between percent slope and the error between Pest and Pmes were considered trivial. Conclusions: Aerodynamic drag (affected by wind velocity and orientation, frontal area, drafting, and speed) is the most confounding factor. The mean estimated values are close to the power-output values measured by power meters, but the random error is between6% and10%. Moreover, at the power outputs (400 W) produced by professional riders, this error is likely to be higher. This observation calls into question the validity of releasing individual values without reporting the range of random errors. © 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Climbing uphill; Gradient; Speed; Tour de France","Adolescent; Adult; Bicycling; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Endurance; Task Performance and Analysis; Wind; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; article; bicycle; biological model; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; endurance; epidemiology; human; male; muscle contraction; muscle strength; physiology; randomized controlled trial; skeletal muscle; statistical model; task performance; wind; young adult","","","","","","","Sassi A., Rampinini E., Martin D.T., Morelli A., Effects of gradient and speed on freely cho sen cadence: The key role of crank inertial load, J Biomech., 42, 2, pp. 171-177, (2009); Vayer A., Froome aussi puissant qu ?Armstrong et Ullrich en 2003, Le Monde, (2013); Ingle S., Cycling must be whiter than white to avoid yellow stain of suspicion, The Guardian, (2013); Dao J., Watchdogs seek doping cl ues from a distance, The New York Times, (2013); Pinot J., Grappe F., The record power profile to assess performance in elite cyclists, Int J Sports Med., 32, 11, pp. 839-844, (2011); Quod M.J., Martin D.T., Martin J.C., Laursen P.B., The power profile predicts road cycling MMP, Int J Sports Med., 31, 6, pp. 397-401, (2010); Di Prampero P.E., Cortili G., Mognoni P., Saibene F., Equation of motion of a cyclist, J Appl Physiol., 47, 1, pp. 201-206, (1979); Martin J.C., Gardner A.S., Barras M., Martin D.T., Modeling sprint cycling using field-derived parameters and forward integration, Med Sci Sports Exerc., 38, 3, pp. 592-597, (2006); Olds T., Modelling human locomotion: Applications to cycling, Sports Med., 31, 7, pp. 497-509, (2001); Olds T.S., Norton K.I., Lowe E.L.A., Olive S., Reay F., Ly S., Modeling roadcycling performance, J Appl Physiol., 78, 4, pp. 1596-1611, (1995); Debraux P., Grappe F., Manolova A.V., Bertucci W., Aerodynamic drag in cycling: Methods of assessment, Sports Biomech., 10, 3, pp. 197-218, (2011); Candau R.B., Grappe F., Menard M., Et al., Simplified deceleration method for assessment of resistive forces in cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc., 31, 10, pp. 1441-1447, (1999); De Groot G., Sargeant A., Geysel J., Air friction and rolling resistance during cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc., 27, 7, pp. 1090-1095, (1995); Garcia-Lopez J., Rodriguez-Marroyo J.A., Juneau C.E., Peleteiro J., Martinez A.C., Villa J.G., Reference values and improvement of aerodynamic drag in professional cyclists, J Sports Sci., 26, 3, pp. 277-286, (2008); Garcia-Lopez J., Ogueta-Alday A., Larrazabal J., Rodriguez-Marroyo J.A., The use of velodrome tests to evaluate aerodynamic drag in professional cyclists, Int J Sports Med., 35, 5, pp. 451-455, (2014); Henchoz Y., Crivelli G., Borrani F., Millet G.P., A new method to measure rolling resistance in treadmill cycling, J Sports Sci., 28, 10, pp. 1043-1046, (2010); Grappe F., Candau R., Barbier B., Hoffman M.D., Belli A., Rouillon J.D., Influence of tyre pressure and vertical load on coefficient of rolling resistance and simulated cycling performance, Ergonomics., 42, 10, pp. 1361-1371, (1999); Vayer A., Portoleau F., Pouvez-vous Gagner le Tour, (2002); (2013); Wooles A., Robinson A., Keen P., A static method for obtaining a calibration factor for SRM bicycle power cranks, Sports Eng., 8, 3, pp. 137-144, (2005); Gardner A.S., Stephens S., Martin D.T., Lawton E., Lee H., Jenkins D., Accuracy of SRM and Power Tap power monitoring systems for bicycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc., 36, 7, pp. 1252-1258, (2004); Jones S.M., Passfield L., The dynamic calibration of bicycle power measuring cranks, The Engineering of Sport, pp. 265-274, (1998); Bland J.M., Altman D.G., Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement, Lancet., 1, pp. 307-310, (1986); Saris W.H.M., Van Erp-Baart M.A., Brouns F., Westertep K.R., Ten Hoor F., Study on food intake and energy expenditure during extreme sustained exercise: The tour de France, Int J Sports Med., 10, SUPPL. 1, (1989); Atkinson G., Davison R., Jeukendrup A., Passfield L., Science and cycling: Current knowledge and future directions for research, J Sports Sci., 21, 9, pp. 767-787, (2003); Ebert T.R., Martin D.T., Stephens B., Mc Donald W., Withers R.T., Fluid and food intake during professional men?s and women?s road-cycling tours, Int J Sports Physiol Perform., 2, 1, pp. 58-71, (2007)","G.P.

These are cheaper modes of transport and therefore attractive at a time of economic crisis, but they also allow their users to avoid traffic congestion. At the same time, active transport modes such as walking and cycling are encouraged because they are beneficial to health and reduce pollution. It is therefore important to find out more about the road crash risks of the different modes of transport. To do this, we need to take account of the number of individuals who use each, and, even better, their travel levels. We estimated the exposure-based fatality rates for road traffic crashes in France, on the basis of the ratio between the number of fatalities and exposure to road accident risk. Fatality data were obtained from the French national police database of road traffic casualties in the period 2007-2008. Exposure data was estimated from the latest national household travel survey (ENTD) which was conducted from April 2007 to April 2008. Three quantities of travel were computed for each mode of transport: (1) the number of trips, 2) the distance travelled and (3) the time spent travelling. Annual fatality rates were assessed by road user type, age and sex. The overall annual fatality rates were 6.3 per 100 million trips, 5.8 per billion kilometers travelled and 0.20 per million hours spent travelling. The fatality rates differed according to road user type, age and sex. The risk of being killed was 20 to 32 times higher for motorized two-wheeler users than for car occupants. For cyclists, the risk of being killed, both on the basis of time spent travelling and the number of trips was about 1.5 times higher than for car occupants. Risk for pedestrians compared to car occupants was similar according to time spent travelling, lower according to the number of trips and higher according to the distance travelled. People from the 17-20 and 21-29 age groups and those aged 70 and over had the highest rates. Males had higher rates than females, by a factor of between 2 and 3. When exposure is taken into account, the risks for motorized two-wheeler users are extremely high compared to other types of road user. This disparity can be explained by the combination of speed and a lack of protection (except for helmets). The differential is so great that prevention measures could probably not eliminate it. The question that arises is as follows: with regard to public health, should not the use of MTW, or at least of motorcycles, be deterred? The difference between the fatality risk of cyclists and of car occupants is much smaller (1.5 times higher); besides, there is much room for improvements in cyclist safety, for instance by increasing the use of helmets and conspicuity equipment. Traffic calming could also benefit cyclists, pedestrians and perhaps moped users. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","mobility; risk assessment; risk exposure; Road traffic accidents; travel survey","","","","","","","","Amoros E., Martin J.L., Laumon B., Under-reporting of road crash casualties in France, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 38, 4, pp. 627-635, (2006);

The attributes used in the stated preference scenarios were: time, facility type, weather, and route gradient. A nested logit model was created to analyse the data. It was found that a tourist is willing to increase their cycling time by approximately 100% in order to cycle upon a fully segregated from traffic cycling facility rather than along a road without cycling infrastructure, and are willing to increase their time by 40-50% to be able to cycle along a road with a cycle lane rather than a road without cycling facilities. Younger, male tourists, who own one or more bikes are more likely to choose a road without cycling facilities, while older, female tourists, who do not own any bikes, are more likely to choose a road with cycle lanes or a segregated from traffic cycling facility.Currently, research into cycling and tourism has not been overly developed. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on research into this area. The research that currently exists is aligned more towards large scale events such as the Tour de France, and adventure tourism in general. This paper casts a light onto the area of cycling for tourist purposes and develops a value based system that can be used in the planning of cycling infrastructure in tourist locations and rural areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cycling; Investment; Sustainable transport","County Dublin; Dublin [County Dublin]; Ireland; Leinster; cycle transport; infrastructure planning; investment; tourism management; tourist behavior; transportation infrastructure; sustainable development; transportation planning","","","","","National Roads Authority of Ireland","The authors would like to thank “Trinity Walking Tours” and the “Shamrockers Adventures” companies for assisting with the intercept surveys.

This paper examines how the events surrounding Froome’s victory in the 2013 Tour de France were reported in the British (London-based) print media the day after his victory. Data were collected from nine different daily newspapers on 22 July with a total of 52 pages of coverage devoted to the story. Thematic coding revealed that, despite a comprehensive victory, Froome appeared to be framed as being in the shadow of two other prominent cyclists. Firstly, Froome’s victory appeared to be framed within a moral panic surrounding the use of performance-enhancing drugs in cycling, with his achievements partially overshadowed by the ‘folk devil’ that is Lance Armstrong. Secondly, the data suggested that narratives around British national identity were prevalent within the reporting of Chris Froome, with this reporting particularly focused on the issue of his African heritage. Initial analysis indicated that the British print media actually celebrated Froome’s African roots, suggesting that they may be starting to embrace a new post-imperial form of national identity that reflects the multicultural or hybrid nature of 21st century Britain. However, we would also argue that Froome may only have achieved an ambivalent position as a British hero and that his African heritage – although celebrated to an extent – means that in the eyes of the British print media he still sits below Sir Bradley Wiggins in what might be described as a ‘hierarchy of Britishness’. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","British identity; doping; moral panic; print media; Tour de France","","","","","","","","Abt S., In High Gear, (1990); Alexander D., Ochowicz J., Tour de France’86: The American Invasion, (1986); Anderson B., Imagined Communities, (1983); Armstrong L., It’s Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, (2000); Bradley Wiggins wins 2012 Tour de France, (2012); Lance Armstrong: USADA report labels him ‘a serial cheat’, (2012); Lance Armstrong & Oprah Winfrey: Cyclist sorry for doping, (2013); Tour de France: Chris Froome wins 100th edition of race, (2013); Tour de France: Chris Froome’s rocky road to glory in Paris, (2013); Biscomb K., Griggs G., ‘A splendid effort!’ Print media reporting of England’s women’s performance in the 2009 Cricket World Cup, International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 48, 1, pp. 99-111, (2012); Brewer B., Commercialization in professional cycling 1950–2001: Institutional transformations and the rationalization of “doping, Sociology of Sport Journal, 19, pp. 276-301, (2002); Brown J., Two out of three ain’t bad – A tour de force for British sport, The Independent, (2013); Burdsey D., Role with the punches: The construction and representation of Amir Khan as a role model for multiethnic Britain, Sociological Review, 55, 3, pp. 611-631, (2007); Butryn T., Masucci M., It’s not about the book: A cyborg counternarrative of Lance Armstrong, Journal of Sport & Social Issues, 27, 2, pp. 124-144, (2003); Carroll R., Lance Armstrong admits doping in Oprah Winfrey interview, (2013); Chadband I., Froome mentor hails ‘great day for Africa’, The Daily Telegraph, pp. S10-S11, (2013); Cohen S., Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of Mods and Rockers, (1972); Elias N., The Society of Individuals, (1991); Elias N., The Germans, (1996); Elias N., Scotson J., The Established and the Outsiders, (1994); Ewen N., John Terry and the predicament of Englishness: Ambivalence and nostalgia in the Premier League era, Sport in History, 33, 4, pp. 465-487, (2013); Fotheringham A., Bargain strikers, Cycle Sport, (1999); Fotheringham A., Froome seals his place as new tour de force, Daily Express, (2013); Fotheringham W., After Wiggo, Froome takes the Tour in Paris, The Guardian, (2013); Fotheringham W., Sky’s the limit for this multinational force, The Guardian, (2013); Friel J., The Cyclist’s Training Bible, (1996); Garland J., The same old story?

In particular, we try to understand how these interactions determine the reported attitudes towards doping products and methods. We focused on the interactions within the work group to understand how young cyclists learn their job. While analysing this organization of work, our goal is to understand how it influences the perception of the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).

On the one hand, there is a long list of places that the Tour de France has visited just once in its whole history, but on the other, there are also several places that different editions include fairly regularly. Since the Tour de France is one of the most watched sports events on the planet, spatial variability is a good means for promoting the different regions of France and the surrounding countries where individual stages have been held. The organisation of individual editions does not depend on the existence of purpose-built sports stadiums but makes use of the existing infrastructure and settlement structure that have developed over long periods. By showing the finish places, we are able to capture not only the frequency of the inclusion of the places in the race, but also show the success of cyclists from different countries at each stage finish and thus identify the countries that have historically been most successful at winning stages. © 2017 The Author(s).

Twin and family studies have shown that approximately 50% of the variance in a number of performance-related phenotypes (whether measured at baseline, i.e., natural talent, or in response to training) including those important to cycling can be explained by genetic variation. Research into the specific genetic variants that are responsible has identified over 200 genes containing common genetic variants involved in the genetic predisposition to physical performance. However, typically these explain only a small portion of the variance, perhaps 1–2% and collectively they rarely explain anything approaching the 50% of the variance identified in the twin and family studies. Thus, there is a gap in our understanding of the relationship between heritability and performance. This gap may be bridged by investigation of rare variants or epigenetic variation or by altering study designs through increased collaborations to pool existing cohorts together. Initial findings from such efforts show promising results. This mini-review will touch on the genetics and epigenetics of sporting performance, how they relate to cyclists in the Tour de France and where best future efforts may be directed as well as discuss some preliminary research findings. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Athlome;

These are cheaper modes of transport and therefore attractive at a time of economic crisis, but they also allow their users to avoid traffic congestion. At the same time, active transport modes such as walking and cycling are encouraged because they are beneficial to health and reduce pollution. It is therefore important to find out more about the road crash risks of the different modes of transport. To do this, we need to take account of the number of individuals who use each, and, even better, their travel levels.; Method We estimated the exposure-based fatality rates for road traffic crashes in France, on the basis of the ratio between the number of fatalities and exposure to road accident risk. Fatality data were obtained from the French national police database of road traffic casualties in the period 2007-2008. Exposure data was estimated from the latest national household travel survey (ENTD) which was conducted from April 2007 to April 2008. Three quantities of travel were computed for each mode of transport: (1) the number of trips, (2) the distance traveled and (3) the time spent traveling. Annual fatality rates were assessed by road user type, age and sex.; Results The overall annual fatality rates were 6.3 per 100 million trips, 5.8 per billion kilometers traveled and 0.20 per million hours spent traveling. The fatality rates differed according to road user type, age and sex. The risk of being killed was 20 to 32 times higher for motorized two-wheeler users than for car occupants. For cyclists, the risk of being killed, both on the basis of time spent traveling and the number of trips was about 1.5 times higher than for car occupants. Risk for pedestrians compared to car occupants was similar according to time spent traveling, lower according to the number of trips and higher according to the distance traveled. People from the 17-20 and 21-29 age groups and those aged 70 and over had the highest rates. Males had higher rates than females, by a factor of between 2 and 3.; Conclusion When exposure is taken into account, the risks for motorized two-wheeler users are extremely high compared to other types of road user. This disparity can be explained by the combination of speed and a lack of protection (except for helmets). The differential is so great that prevention measures could probably not eliminate it. The question that arises is as follows: with regard to public health, should not the use of MTW, or at least of motorcycles, be deterred? The difference between the fatality risk of cyclists and of car occupants is much smaller (1.5 times higher); besides, there is much room for improvements in cyclist safety, for instance by increasing the use of helmets and conspicuity equipment. Traffic calming could also benefit cyclists, pedestrians and perhaps moped users. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A detailed survey of French press and television coverage over the last decade reveals competing media discourses concerning his importance as a source of nostalgia, accusations of vulgarity and racism in his work, and his portrayal in the 2008 biopic Coluche, l’histoire d’un mec. At the same time, coverage generates more consensual representations of Coluche—as an ordinary and extraordinary star, a political activist, an LGBTQ-friendly figure, a representative of a French biker culture based on social solidarity, a distinguished public figure worthy of comparison with other well-known individuals, a subject for impersonation and a source of inspiration to other performers. In addition, Coluche’s case study indicates possible media-specific approaches to the representation of posthumous celebrity. © 2019, © 2019 Association for the Study of Modern & Contemporary France.","","","","","","","British Academy/Leverhulme Trust, (SG122104); Institut National de l?Audiovisuel","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust [grant number SG122104].; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust [grant number SG122104].

[TUDelft 2016] The drag of different suits was optimized in the Delft wind tunnel. However, as one can't place a professional cyclist in a wind tunnel for weeks on end. For this, a 3D printed mannequin with the exact same physical measurements was made. An essential benefit using an exact replica in the wind tunnel is that it remains perfectly still, making the measurements of the airflows around the body much quicker and more accurate. Additive manufacturing was not chosen as easiest option, it lead to a collection of research opportunities. The process includes scanning, 3D segmenting, printing strategy and printing, assembling and testing. The complete process wasdone in less then 2,5 months. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","3D print; 3D scan; FDM; FFF; PIV; Segmenting; Slicing; Wind tunnel","Frequency division multiplexing; Industrial research; Printing; Wind tunnels; 3-d scans; 3d prints; Measurements of; Physical measurement; Professional cyclists; Research opportunities; Segmenting; Slicing; 3D printers","","","","","","","Bethe T., 3D Scanning, (2016); Terra W., Sciacchitano A., Scarano F., Drag analysis from PIV data in speed sports, Procedia Engineering, 147, 2016, pp. 50-55, (2016); Video Covering this Process, (2016); Van Tubergen J., 3D Printing with Z-Unlimited, (2016)","","Spencer S.N.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (ACM SIGGRAPH)","1st Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication, SCF 2017","12 June 2017 through 13 June 2017","Cambridge","128271","","978-145034999-4","","","English","Proc. - SCF: ACM Symp.

This is the first attempt made to this end in the sports economics literature. Two hypotheses were addressed. H1: Non-participation in previous Grand Tours results in being more successful in the following Grand Tour. H2: Sparing effort in stages before a stage in which the likelihood of a successful breakaway is higher increases the probability of being part of the breakaway.  Research methods: We use the whole sample of riders who finished two Grand Tours: the 2010 Tour de France and the 2009 Vuelta a España. For H1, ordinary least squares (OLS) is used to estimate a model in which the dependent variable is the cyclist's position in the final ranking. For H2, a discrete choice model was estimated to explain the probability of a rider being a member of the successful breakaway in stage X. Results and findings: In the case of H1 no significant evidence was found. In terms of H2, poorer performance in the preceding stage increased the likelihood of being a member of a successful breakaway. This effect is insignificant if the previous stage was flat and/or was in the first week of the competition, is clearly discernible in medium mountain stages and becomes greater as the competition progresses and in the Tour de France.  Implications: This paper presents the first evidence of strategic resting in cycling. Other incentives can be analysed by future researchers (secondary classification, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) points system). © 2015 European Association for Sport Management.","cycling; Grand Tour; strategic resting; team effects","","","","","","","","Balsdon W., Fong L., Thayer M., Corruption in College Basketball?

Many athletes miss considerable time from sport and require surgical intervention. Little is known about the epidemiology of injuries to guide practice participation strategies, return-to-competition expectations, and injury prevention protocols. Purpose: To evaluate the injury epidemiology, operative incidence, and return-to-competition timeline among all elite cyclists participating in the 21-stage Tour de France race over a span of 8 years. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiological study. Methods: All injuries sustained during 1584 unique rides by cyclists participating in the Tour de France from 2010 to 2017 were evaluated. In the absence of an established Tour de France injury database, demographic, injury, surgical, and return-to-competition details from all athletes who withdrew because of a traumatic injury were retrospectively compiled using publicly available data, which were cross-referenced for validity. The inclusion criterion consisted of any cyclist who withdrew from the Tour de France because of an injury; cyclists who withdrew for noninjury reasons were excluded. Independent variables included injury demographics, missed days, and whether the injury required surgery. Injury prevalence, relative frequency distributions, and sample proportions were dependent metrics for this investigation. Results: Among the 1584 cycling entries evaluated over the 8-year study period, there were 259 cyclists (16%) who withdrew (17 cyclists/year). A total of 138 withdrawals were caused by acute trauma, 49% of which were fractures (n = 67), which represented the most common reason for withdrawal. A total of 29 (43%) cyclists with fractures underwent surgery. The most commonly fractured bones were the clavicle (n = 21), followed by the wrist (n = 6), hand (n = 5), femur (n = 5), humerus (n = 5), and ribs (n = 5). Cyclists who underwent operative fracture fixation had a longer time between the injury and their next race compared with those who did not undergo surgery (77 vs 44 days, respectively; P =.065). Conclusion: The most common injury leading to withdrawal from the Tour de France over the study period was acute fracture, comprising 49% of all injuries. Almost half of the cyclists with fractures underwent surgery. The clavicle was the most commonly fractured bone. For cyclists who underwent operative treatment of their fractures, return to competition was more than 1 month longer than for those who did not. A prospective database is warranted to catalog injuries among these elite cyclists. © The Author(s) 2018.","cycling; economic and decision analysis; general sports trauma; medical aspects of sports","","","","","","","","Bagherian S., Rahnama N., Epidemiology of injury in professional cyclists, Br J Sports Med, 44, (2010); Barrios C., Bernardo N., Vera P., Laiz C., Hadala M., Changes in sports injuries incidence over time in world-class road cyclists, Int J Sports Med, 36, 3, pp. 241-248, (2014); Barrios C., Sala D., Terrados N., Valenti J.R., Traumatic and overuse injuries in elite professional cyclists, Sports Exerc Inj, 3, 4, pp. 176-179, (1997); Clarsen B., Krosshaug T., Bahr R., Overuse injuries in professional road cyclists, Am J Sports Med, 38, 12, pp. 2494-2501, (2010); Cycling news & race results; De Bernardo N., Barrios C., Vera P., Laiz C., Hadala M., Incidence and risk for traumatic and overuse injuries in top-level road cyclists, J Sports Sci, 30, 10, pp. 1047-1053, (2012); Decock M., De Wilde L., Vanden Bossche L., Steyaert A., Van Tongel A., Incidence and aetiology of acute injuries during competitive road cycling, Br J Sports Med, 50, 11, pp. 669-672, (2016); Greve M.W., Modabber M.R., An epidemic of traumatic brain injury in professional cycling, Clin J Sport Med, 22, 2, pp. 81-82, (2012); Henderson L., Injury surveillance system kickoff, Appl Clin Trials, 21, 10, (2012); Lippi G., Mattiuzzi C., Mandatory wearing of helmets for elite cyclists: new perspectives in prevention of head injuries, Br J Sports Med, 38, 3, (2004); Mellion M.B., Common cycling injuries: management and prevention, Sports Med, 11, 1, pp. 52-70, (1991); Pollack K.M., D'Angelo J., Green G., Et al., Developing and implementing Major League Baseball’s health and injury tracking system, Am J Epidemiol, 183, 5, pp. 490-496, (2016); Sanner W.H., O'Halloran W.D., The biomechanics, etiology, and treatment of cycling injuries, J Am Podiatr Med Assoc, 90, 7, pp. 354-376, (2000); Schwellnus M., Derman E., Common injuries in cycling: prevention, diagnosis and management, South African Fam Pract, 47, 7, pp. 14-19, (2005); Starkey C., Injuries and illnesses in the National Basketball Association: a 10-year perspective, J Athl Train, 35, 2, pp. 161-167, (2000); Implementation protocol: calculation of time gaps for stages “expected to finish in bunch sprints.; UCI cycling regulations part 1: general organization of cycling as a sport; UCI cycling regulations part 2: road races; Wanich T., Hodgkins C., Columbier J.A., Muraski E., Kennedy J.G., Cycling injuries of the lower extremity, J Am Acad Orthop Surg, 15, 12, pp. 748-756, (2007); Wilber C.A., Holland G.J., Madison R.E., Loy S.F., An epidemiological analysis of overuse injuries among recreational cyclists, Int J Sports Med, 16, 3, pp. 201-206, (1995); Wynn N., Tour de France 2017 start list","P.N.

We investigate how these factors influenced wrongdoing in the context of professional cyclists' use of banned performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in advance of the 2010 Tour de France. This empirical setting provides two advantages: It permits evaluation of a wider range of potential determinants of wrongdoing than is conventionally possible, and it allows for the use of a measure of wrongdoing that is not subject to the type of bias that plagues most previously used indicators. We find substantial support for our prediction that actors who perform critical organizational roles are more likely to engage in wrongdoing. Further, we find that while undifferentiated social ties to known wrongdoers did not increase the likelihood of wrongdoing, ties to unpunished offenders increased the probability of wrongdoing and ties to severely punished offenders decreased it. These effects were robust to consideration of other known causes of wrongdoing in organizations: Weak governance regimes and permissive cultural contexts, performance strain, and individual propensities to engage in wrongdoing. © The Author 2015.","","","","","","","","","Agrawal A., Chado S., Corporate Governance and Accounting Scandals, Journal of Law and Economics, 48, pp. 371-406, (2005);

A previous study has been developed in order to justify and validate the final design of the unmet needs of people in their daily lives, with an emphasis on satisfying those that imply specific savings, whether economic, energy or time. As a result, the use of bicycles as a means of transport in Spain is promoted taking as a frame of reference countries such as the Netherlands or France. This means economic and energy savings (by replacing the car) and an improvement in people’s health and quality of life. Following the steps of the design methodology, once the need was detected, an information search was carried out in order to identify and prioritize the design specifications that meet the demands of potential customers. For this reason, various sources were used, Cyclelogistics (2013), a European project; a report “Food in Spain” by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment (2017), and the annual bicycle barometer developed by the DGT (Dirección General de Tráfico, 2017) where the opinion, habits and use that the Spanish people make of the bicycle and the needs and demands they have in relation to it, is known. In addition to meeting the needs of the client, the design must comply with a set of reference regulations both, at the level of security devices and the transport of merchandise at retail. The result of the work has given rise to patent application with prior examination at a national level, in a first phase, and subsequently, at an international level. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Anti-theft lock; Cargo bikes; Patent; Product design","Agriculture; Bicycles; Crime; Energy conservation; Locks (fasteners); Patents and inventions; Anti-theft lock; Cargo bike; Daily lives; Economic energy; Economic savings; Energy-savings; Frames of reference; Multifunctional devices; Netherlands; Patent; Product design","","","","","","","Woods R., Masthoff J., A comparison of car driving, public transport and cycling experiences in three European cities, Transp Res Part A, 103, pp. 211-222, (2017); Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport: Special Eurobarometer 422A, (2014); Cycle Logistics Moving Europe Forward; DGT Journal; Red De Ciudades Por La Bicicleta: Barómetro De La Bicicleta 2017, (2017); Lahrmann H., Madsen T.K.O., Olesen A.V., Randomized trials and self-reported accidents as a method to study safety-enhancing measures for cyclists—two case studies, Accid Anal Prev, 114, pp. 17-24, (2018); van Lierop D., Grimsrud M., El-Geneidy A., Breaking into bicycle theft: Insights from Montreal, Canada, Int J Sustain Transp, 9, 7, pp. 490-501, (2015); Foley L., Dumuid D., Atkin A.J., Olds T., Ogilvie D., Patterns of health behaviour associated with active travel: A compositional data analysis, Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act, 15, (2018); Milani Medeiros R., Duarte F., Policy to promote bicycle use or bicycle to promote politicians?

Seven priority work areas were highlighted: creation of municipal synergy, training of local actors in the implementation of ""Physical Activity and Health"" joint projects, creation of local courses to identify/inform/advise and guide residents towards adapted physical activities, implementation of programmes combining physical activity and a balanced diet in primary and secondary schools, community centres and municipal school sports. Results: Regular meetings between local partners/actors facilitate the implementation of many projects that meet the expectations/needs of residents and professionals. For example, in a community centre, women and children learned to ride a bike, mediators passed a diploma to supervise groups, outings were organized and the planning authority/department decided to study the feasibility of building cycle paths. Conclusion: The sharing of ideas and local resources constitutes a lever to encourage physical activity and reduces social inequalities in health. A partnership culture between sport, social, education and health structures must be developedin orderto integrate physical activity as one of the Local Health Contract's priorities.","Adolescent/child; Healthcare disparities; Intersectoral partnership; Local government; Physical exercise","Adolescent; Child; Exercise; France; Health Plan Implementation; Humans; Intersectoral Collaboration; Physical Education and Training; Public-Private Sector Partnerships; School Health Services; Surveys and Questionnaires; child; diet; exercise; expectation; feasibility study; female; government; health care disparity; high school; human; human experiment; joint; mediator; physical activity; resident; sport; adolescent; France; health care planning; intersectoral collaboration; organization and management; physical education; procedures; public-private partnership; questionnaire; school health service; standards; article","","","","","","","Institut national de la sante et de la recherchemedicale (Inserm), Inégalités Sociales de Santé en Lien Avec l'Alimentation et l'Activité Physique, (2014); Ortega F.B., Ruiz J.R., Castillo M.J., Sjostrom M., Physical fitness in childhood and adolescence: A powerful marker of health, Int J Obes, 32, 1, pp. 1-11, (2008); Vanhelst J., Fardy P.S., Chapelot D., Czaplicki G., Physical fitness levels of adolescents in the Ile de France region: Comparisons with Europeans standards and relevance for future cardiovascular risk, Clinical Physiology and Functional Imaging.

We characterise user mobilities and produce a user typology based on cluster analysis, relying on intensity and on annual and weekly temporal patterns.

Excluding three tailwind-dominated stages, where our worst error was 7.79%, we predicted all other stages to better than 5%, including five stages that we predicted to better than 1%.

Though the UK has gradually risen to the top of the world's cycling ranks, the technology in the bikes has not changed that much since Katsanis's early designs for British Cycling. Carbon fibers had been refined in other industries, most notably aerospace, so it was more a case of bringing that knowledge across into the sport than inventing something new. Now Katsanis has come full circle, having helped design a carbon-fiber racing wheelchair for the UK that will be used at this year's World Championships. He is also continuing his work with UK Sport, helping in preparations for next year's Winter Olympics a field in which he already has some experience, having helped design parts for the British bobsleigh.

The world-class cyclist’s power output (PO) data and training indices were analysed over six years to determine the evolution of his record power profile and training load (TL), which were estimated by using the session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method. The total annual duration and TL increased through six seasons by 79% and 83%, respectively. The record POs in all exercise intensity zones improved over the six years. The increases in TL, monotony (+34%) and strain (+162%) from the junior category to the world-class level significantly correlated with an improvement in his aerobic potential, which was characterised by an increase in the record POs between 5 min and 4 h.

For this reason, an understanding of the interaction requirements of other road users is needed. The current study investigated these requirements through an analysis of 22 h of video footage of the CityMobil2 AV demonstrations in La Rochelle (France) and Trikala (Greece). Manual and automated video-analysis techniques were used to identify typical interaction patterns between AVs and other road users. Results indicate that road infrastructure and road user factors had a major impact on the type of interactions that arose between AVs and other road users. Road infrastructure features such as road width, and the presence or absence of zebra crossings had an impact on road users’ trajectory decisions while approaching an AV. Where possible, pedestrians and cyclists appeared to leave as much space as possible between their trajectories and that of the AV. However, in situations where the infrastructure did not allow for the separation of traffic, risky behaviours were more likely to emerge, with cyclists, in particular, travelling closely alongside the AVs on narrow parts of the road, rather than waiting for the AV to pass. In addition, the types of interaction varied considerably across socio-demographic groups, with females and older users more likely to show cautionary behaviour around the AVs than males, or younger road users. Overall, the results highlight the importance of implementing the correct infrastructure to support the safe introduction of AVs, while also ensuring that the behaviour of the AV matches other road users’ expectations as closely as possible in order to avoid traffic conflicts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","","Automation; Motor transportation; Automated roads; Automated vehicles; Automated video; Demographic groups; Interaction pattern; Road infrastructures; Traffic conflicts; Traffic environment; Roads and streets","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (314190); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","The research presented in this paper was supported by the CityMobil2 project, funded through the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (Grant no. 314190 ).

This bike model is the ""safety bicycle"" 1870's model. May be it is not the most efficient form and, for sure, not the latest developed. The improvement had not been so important. There was indeed a big jump in the late 80's/early 90's, some of which could be attributed both to an increase in time trials and, may be, also to the doping practices of the time. In any case, doping of some form or another has been going on since the beginning of the Tour de France. Time trials are crucial for average speed and it may be they are entirely responsible for the improvement. In any case many other significant advantages have been made on the man-machine.

It aims to investigate the determinants of helmet wearing and to explore its evolution from 2000 to 2010. The analysis relies on data from a series of general population surveys called ""Health Barometers"": 2000 (n = 13,163), 2005 (n = 25,651) and 2010 (n = 8573). Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify factors associated with helmet use and time trends. Nearly half of the 15-75 year olds surveyed reported that they rode a bicycle, and among these cyclists, 22.0% reported that they wore a helmet on their last ride. Further analysis by gender reveals that twice as many men than women wore helmets. Over the last decade, helmet use among cyclists has clearly increased, from 7.3% in 2000 to 22.0% in 2010, whereas the influence of social and economic factors, such as unemployment and wage disparities, appears to have decreased. Several determinants of bicycle helmet use were highlighted. To improve the effectiveness of further public information campaigns on helmet use, the key target groups should include women, under 25 year olds and people living in urban areas. Promoting the wearing of helmets among families should also be enhanced, given the higher rate of helmet use by parents as well as children. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Soon after the sudden rupture of a cable near the anchorage, the bridge was closed to traffic. Inspections were carried out to understand the sources of this event and to assess the performance of cables and strand sockets. Prior to rehabilitation, the bridge safety was improved by strengthening each socket; the bridge was then re-opened to pedestrians and cyclists only. An acoustic emission system was installed during a full year period; events related to cable ruptures were accordingly monitored. Meanwhile, several other experimental investigations on steel and concrete materials (resilience, tensile steel strength, carbonation and chloride ingresses) were led to estimate the residual structural service life of the bridge and to plan repair actions. A major rehabilitation program was then scheduled with the change of all cables and sockets. This paper presents the different stages of these investigations and the rehabilitation process.","Acoustic emission; Cable rupture; Rehabilitation; Strengthening; Suspension bridge","Acoustic emissions; Cables; Chlorine compounds; Patient rehabilitation; Pedestrian safety; Strengthening (metal); Suspension bridges; Acoustic emission systems; Chloride ingress; Concrete materials; Damage characterization; Different stages; Experimental investigations; Rehabilitation programs; Tensile steels; Acoustic emission testing","","","","","","","","","","International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE)","","36th International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering Symposium on Long Span Bridges and Roofs - Development, Design and Implementation","24 September 2013 through 27 September 2013","Kolkata","111977","","978-385748128-4","","","English","Long Span Bridges Roofs - Dev., Des.

This scheme started in 2005 and has now around 350 stations and 4500 bikes in operation, with more than 50,000 annual members. By the means of an Internet-based survey more than 3000 respondents were described by their detailed socio-demographic profile, their travel means and habits, a one-day activity-travel diary and additionally a seven days activity-travel diary filled by around 700 volunteers. By this way the survey covers all travel modes and day-to-day variations in travel behavior beyond the sole use of shared bike. We analyze with a discrete choice model the socio-demographic and spatial factors affecting the probability of being an annual member of the Velo'v scheme. Then we compare with descriptive statistics their daily travel behavior involving as well bike sharing as other traditional modes to the travel behavior of the general population as given with the latest Household Travel Survey available in the Lyon area (2015). The majority of Velo'v annual members are male, younger and hold higher social positions when compared with the Lyon's general population. An individual higher social position and the residential proximity to stations have both separate and positive effects on the probability of being an annual member of the service. Velo'v members are not captive from public transport, a majority of them have access to a car and they are fully multimodal in their day-to-day travel behavior. Velo'v bikes are used by them for any activity, not necessarily every day, like any other travel mode. The multimodal behavior of Velo'v members shows that Velo'v supply fits especially a demand not satisfied when the public transport station is too distant from home. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Annual membership; Bike-sharing; Discrete choice model; Lyon; One week travel diary","France; Lyons; Rhone; Rhone-Alpes; Bicycles; Population statistics; Annual membership; Bike-sharing; Demographic profile; Discrete choice models; Lya; One week travel diary; Sharing schemes; Sociodemographics; Travel behaviour; Travel modes; cycle transport; discrete choice analysis; public transport; transportation mode; travel behavior; Surveys","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-12-SOIN-0001)","This work was supported by the French “ Agence Nationale de la Recherche ” [Grant ANR-12-SOIN-0001 ].

Although a preference for physically fitter males is therefore predicted, the relationship between attractiveness and performance has rarely been quantified. Here, I test for such a relationship in humans and ask whether variation in (endurance) performance is associated with variation in facial attractiveness within elite professional cyclists that finished the 2012 Tour de France. I show that riders that performed better were more attractive, and that this preference was strongest in women not using a hormonal contraceptive. Thereby, I show that, within this preselected but relatively homogeneous sample of the male population, facial attractiveness signals endurance performance. Provided that there is a relationship between performance-mediated attractiveness and reproductive success, this suggests that human endurance capacity has been subject to sexual selection in our evolutionary past. © 2014 The Authors.","Cycling; Endurance performance; Humans; Mate preference; Sexual selection","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Athletes; Beauty; Bicycling; Face; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sexual Behavior; Visual Perception; Young Adult; France; cycling; endurance performance; humans; mate preference; sexual selection; biological method; hormone; human activity; performance assessment; physical property; signaling; adolescent; adult; aged; article; athlete; bicycle; cycling; endurance performance; esthetics; face; female; human; male; mate choice; middle aged; sexual behavior; sexual selection; vision; young adult","","","","","","","Andersson M., Sexual Selection, (1994); Lailvaux S.P., Irschick D.J., A functional perspective on sexual selection: Insights and future prospects, Anim.

As a mid-size city in France, Dijon appears as a good example of the current trends in city greening around Western Europe. The label of «green city» has become essential in the promotion of urban areas for tourism and job creations, as is shown by the city rankings published in mainstream magazines. City planning, as in other cities of the same size (about 250,000 residents), is run by the Communauté d'agglomération Dijonnaise, «Grand Dijon», with competencies in transportation, housing and land use planning. According to French laws, a greater emphasis is now given to «solidarity» in the governance of urban areas (= social housing in all municipalities, and also to sustainability and «green» urban policies. Dijon, after about 20 other French cities, is rediscovering the virtues of streetcars (tramways), considered as a cleaner way to carry population than automobiles or fossil fuel-powered city buses. The implementation of a 2-line streetcar scheme means a reorganization of urban centralities in the Dijon area. The main downtown commercial street, where only buses are allowed now, will be fully pedestrianized at the start of tramway service. Only an electric shuttle will be able to run through the inner heart of the city. The train station will be a major hub for multimodal transfer. Spaces devoted to automobiles around the train terminal have been reduced, but areas reserved for public transportation (buses and the future tramway), pedestrians and bicycles have increased. The tramway route has been designed to link all major activity centers of the city (shopping centers, train station, university, administrative center, soccer stadium, entertainment venues...), in order to maximize ridership and minimize the need to use individual vehicles. The city is also encouraging the use of bicycles, with bike-rental programs, in the downtown area and around the university campus. European countries and cities are promoting its use as an environmentally-friendly way to move around cities. Bicycle is part of the daily-life culture of nations such as the Netherlands or Denmark. It is also making a noticeable comeback in French cities. After a few pioneering cities in the 1990's, many cities have embarked into self-service public bike rental programs, following the 2005 example of Vélov' in Lyon and the powerful impact of the deployment of Vélib in Paris (2007). In most cases, the cities have contracted with a major announcer, JC Decaux for the ""Cyclocity"" or Clear Channel for the ""SmartBike"". This early model is evolving, with public transport conglomerates (Transdev, Keolis, Veolia) now getting in the bicycle providing game. The city of Dijon has gone further to enhance the appeal of bicycles with the implementation of a metro-area wide network of bicycle lanes. Plans are underway on campus to establish new patterns of circulation within the university domain, encourage green mobilities and reduce the use of cars. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Bicycles; City planning; Dijon; France; Streetcar; Sustainable transportation","","","","","","","","Villes et développements durables, CRDP d'Amiens, (2007); Allemand S., Ascher F., Et al., Le sens du mouvement, (2005); Bagaeen S.G., Redeveloping former military sites: Competitiveness, urban sustainability and public participation, Cities, 24, 5, pp. 339-352, (2006); Bertrand V., Du bâtiment au quartier: innovation et développmene tdurable, Bulletin de l'Association de Géographes Français, 87, 3, pp. 420-430, (2010); Boquet Y., Ville et environnement aux Etats-Unis, Ville et environnement, pp. 247-262, (2005); Boquet Y., The return of bicycles as a sustainable transportation tool in France, Transportation and Urban Sustainability, Proceedings of the 15th Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies conference, pp. 55-62, (2010); Boquet Y., From PLU to Eco-PLU: strategies for a sustainable city in Dijon, France"", in J.G.

The aim of the present study is to predict expert responsibility attribution (considered as a gold-standard) from explanatory variables available in crash data routinely recorded by the police, according to a data-driven process with explicit rules. Method: Driver responsibility was assessed by experts using all information contained in police reports for a sample of about 5000 injury crashes that occurred in France in 2011. Three statistical methods were used to predict expert responsibility attribution: logistic regression with L1 penalty, random forests, and boosting. Potential predictors of expert attribution referred to inappropriate driver actions and to external conditions at the time of the crash. Logistic regression was chosen to construct a score to assess responsibility for drivers and riders in crashes involving one or more motor vehicles, or involving a cyclist or pedestrian. Results: Cross-validation showed that our tool can predict expert responsibility assessments on new data sets. In addition, responsibility analyses performed using either the expert responsibility or our predicted responsibility return similar odds ratios. Our scoring process can then be used to reliably assess responsibility based on national police report databases, provided that they include the information needed to construct the score. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and National Safety Council","Crash risk factor; Responsibility analysis; Road crash; Scoring tool; Statistical learning","Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Databases, Factual; Female; France; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Vehicles; Police; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Decision trees; Factor analysis; Forecasting; Highway accidents; Law enforcement; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Crash risk; Cross validation; Explanatory variables; External conditions; Logistic regressions; Responsibility analysis; Road crash; Statistical learning; adolescent; adult; aged; factual database; female; France; human; male; middle aged; motor vehicle; police; psychology; risk factor; statistical analysis; traffic accident; young adult; Risk assessment","","","","","Ministère de l'Intérieur, (16154); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-11-VPTT-0007)","The work was supported by the road safety administration, Ministry of the Interior , grant 16154 , and used data from the VOIESUR project funded by the French National Research Agency , grant ANR-11-VPTT-0007 .

Most of the existing studies are based on police data which understate both single-bicycle accidents as well as cyclist victims. In France, an estimation based on a road trauma database reveals that cyclists are 8 times more likely to be injured per hour spent on the road compared to motorists. To give a full picture of cycling accidents, as well as to understand how cyclist behavior interacts with other factors in causing accidents, we surveyed all injured cyclists in the period 2009–2011, as identified in a medical database of road trauma victims in a French territorial “départment” (the Rhône, capital city Lyon). Using classification methods we build a typology of 17 recurring configurations of cycling collisions and single-bicycle accidents: 7 concern utilitarian riding (commuting…), 3 concern recreational riding and 7 concern cycling as a sporting activity. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is then used to check the consistency of this typology, and to gain additional insight on road user behavior by projection of supplementary variables. External factors contributing to cycling accidents, such as “bad weather” (13%) or “riding at night” (14%), roadway configuration such as “cycling infrastructure” (16%) or “intersections” (25%), and cyclist behavior such as “alcohol consumption” (5%) or “speed” (25%) are discriminatory variables that interact in many accident configurations.

Two initiatives developed in Nantes allowed estimation of the benefits as perceived by local authorities as well as the motivations of cyclists and the general population. The City Council and the metropolitan area of Greater Nantes used the HEAT tool, which identifies the economic health benefit of increasing active forms of transport at the population level. The number of deaths avoided and the economic benefits were calculated by using both current and 2030-projected cycling rates and mortality rates. HEAT shows that, at current cycling rates, the health benefits result in 120 deaths avoided over 10 years for the city of Nantes (260 for the metropolitan area) with an economic benefit of €461,000,000 (€1,005,000,000 for the metropolitan area). A study of bike usage carried out in Greater Nantes based on interviews of cyclists and the general population showed that health and well-being were the leading reasons cited for cycling. The study showed an overrepresentation of academicallyqualified men amongst cyclists. This inter-sectorial approach reinforced the exchanges between politicians and staff in both the transport and health sectors. It also allowed sharing of objectives and joint actions notably in the form of the 2015-2020 Cycling Plan, which is designed to promote cycling among people not currently using this modality.","Active mobility; Decision-making tool; Economic evaluation; Healthy cities; Physical activity","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bicycling; Child; Female; France; Health Plan Implementation; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Preventive Health Services; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transportation; Urbanization; Young Adult; city; decision making; economic evaluation; heat; human; interview; joint; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; physical activity; population; public figure; staff; wellbeing; adult; article; cyclist; death toll; adolescent; aged; child; cycling; economics; epidemiology; female; France; health care planning; middle aged; organization and management; preventive health service; procedures; questionnaire; standards; statistics and numerical data; traffic and transport; urbanization; very elderly; young adult","","","","","","","Inserm, Activité Physique - Contextes et Effets sur la santé, (2008); Reseau Francais des Villes-Sante de l'OMS, Mobilités Actives au Quotidien, le Rôle des Collectivités.

It appears as though we are constantly involved in sharing activities in our daily physical and digital lives. Images, feelings or thoughts are shared on social media platforms; we share cars (e.g. Zipcar), bikes, homes and beds (e.g. Airbnb and Couchsurfing), money and other resources (e.g. Wemakeit and Kickstarter). These different practices, their impact and adjoining conceptual frameworks are controversially debated within the Smart City Debate and the Sharing Discourse (e.g. tourism phenomena related to Airbnb). ‘Sharing’ emphasizes the utilization of underused resources and the shift from owning things or goods to sharing them. So far, less attention has been paid to ‘new’ sharing models or approaches in rural contexts. In this article we take a first step by mapping and comparing ‘cow sharing’ arrangements within the European Alpine Region as one of such rural and digitally mediated formats of sharing practices. 60 cow sharing arrangements in five countries (Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Italy) are mapped and investigated through the lens of property rights (Schlager and Ostrom, 1992) and the sharing paradigm. Farmers’ main motivation to enter sharing arrangements are the direct marketing of high-quality products and the intensified social relations with tourists and consumers. The analysis of the cow sharing arrangements shows two different types: (i) ‘authorized users’ and (ii) ‘withdrawal-focused crowding arrangements’, that illustrate new farmer-consumer (share giver-share taker) relations which are mediated by digital platforms. They share different bundles of rights, mainly withdrawal (e.g. milk, cheese, meat) or access rights (e.g. cow visits, exploring Alpine pastures/farm), while share takers hold all management, exclusion and alienation rights while also bearing the major risks and obligations within the sharing arrangement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alpine treaties; European Alps; Land-use; Property rights; Resource management; Sharing economy","Austria; Europe; France; Germany; Italy; Switzerland; agricultural economics; farmers attitude; land use; livestock farming; marketing; property rights; resource management","","","","","","","Acheson J.M., Ostrom for anthropologists, Int.

However, the epidemiological sources concerning sports accidents are less detailed in France and regularly included in wider studies. The objective of our study was to analyze the distribution of the infantile sports traumas and to highlight sports associated to severe injuries. This epidemiological study took place on April 2014 and April 2015 in the surgical pediatric emergencies of Strasbourg University Hospitals (France) and collected all traumas led by a physical activity. Five hundred fifty-three children from 11 months old to 18 years old were included: 62% boys and 38% girls. We listed 26 physical activities. The main sports suppliers were football, bike, playground and roller-wheel. Contusion was the most frequent lesion. A lesion on four was a fracture/dislocation or a sprain. Fourteen percent of injuries were cuts, especially children less than 10 years (P < 0.01). In more than 70% cases, arms and legs were concerned. Head represented 15% injuries. Trunk and rachis were affected in 5% cases. Median AIS score of our cohort was 1 [1–2]. The rate of hospitalization was 8%. Roller, BMX and skateboard had a high potential of severe hurts. © SFMU et Lavoisier SAS 2019.","Everyday accidents; Pediatric sports injuries","adolescent; Article; child; child hospitalization; contusion; dislocation; female; football; fracture; France; head injury; human; infant; leg injury; male; physical activity; risk factor; roller skating; sport injury; sprain; youth sport","","","","","","","Four R., Alamir H., Babe P., Et al., Évaluation de l’activité d’un service d’urgences pédiatriques, J Eur Urgences, 15, pp. 59-69, (2008); Thelot B., Darlot J., Nectoux M., Hubert I., Épidémiologie des accidents de sport et de loisirs chez les enfants et les adolescents, Santé Homme, 354, pp. 21-23, (2001); Ceroni D., Kaelin A., Traumatismes du sport en pédiatrie, RMS, (2004); Rating the severity of tissue damage: The abbreviated scale, JAMA, 215, pp. 277-280, (1971); Durbin D., Localio A., MacKenzie E., Validation of the ICD/AIS MAP for pediatric use, Inj Prev, 7, pp. 96-99, (2001); Chiron M., Guillemot H., Ndiaye A., Thelot B., Description Et Gravité Des Lésions Traumatiques Selon Les Classifications AIS 1998 Et IIS 1994, (2003); Scherer C., Prévention des accidents chez les enfants jus-qu’à 16 ans, Bureau De Prévention Des Accidents, (2010); Patel D.P., Redshaw J.D., Breyer B.N., Et al., High-grade renal injuries are often isolated in sports-related trauma, Injury, 46, pp. 1245-1249, (2015); Torjussen J., Bahr R., Injuries among elite snowboarders (FIS Snowboard World Cup), Br J Sports Med, 40, pp. 230-234, (2006); Amoros E., Chiron M., Thelot B., Laumon B., The injury epidemiology of cyclists based on a road trauma registry, BMC Public Health, 11, pp. 653-665, (2011); Selassie A.W., Wilson D.A., Pickelsimer E.E., Et al., Incidence of sport-related traumatic brain injury and risk factors of severity: A population-based epidemiologic study, Ann Epidemiol, 23, pp. 750-756, (2013); Lorton F., Levieux K., Vrignaud B., Et al., Actualisation des recommandations pour la prise en charge du traumatisme crânien léger chez l’enfant, J Eur Urgences Reanim, 26, pp. 222-228, (2015); Purcell L.K., L’évaluation et la prise en charge des commotions cérébrales liées au sport, Paediatr Child Health, 19, pp. 159-165, (2014); Razemon O., Le casque obligatoire pour les moins de 12 ans circulant à bicyclette, Le Monde, (2017); Callewaert D., Frydel Y., Des équipements sportifs moins nombreux en Alsace mais faciles d’accès, Insee, (2014)","M.

The three major professional cycling stages races (i.e. Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España) require cyclists to compete daily covering between ~150-200 km for three consecutive weeks. Anecdotal evidence indicates that such an event has a signiicant effect on the sleep, mood, and general well-being of cyclists, particularly during the latter stages of the event. The primary aim of this study was to simulate a grand tour and determine the impact a grand tour has on the sleep, mood, and general well-being of competitive cyclists. Methods. Twenty-one male cyclists (M±SD, age 22.2±2.7 years) were examined for 39 days across three phases (i.e. baseline, simulated grand tour, and recovery). Sleep was assessed using sleep diaries and wrist activity monitors. Mood and general well-being were assessed using the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Results. The amount and quality of sleep as assessed by the wrist activity monitors declined during the simulated grand tour. In contrast, self-reported sleep quality improved throughout the study. Cyclists' mood and general well-being as indicated by vigour, motivation, physical and mental state declined during the simulated tour. Conclusion. Future investigations should examine sleep, mood and well-being during an actual grand tour. Such data could prove instrumental toward understanding the sleep and psychological changes that occur during a grand tour.","Athletes; Bicycling; Monitoring, Physiologic; Sleep","Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Affect; Anaerobic Threshold; Athletes; Athletic Performance; Australia; Bicycling; Competitive Behavior; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Education and Training; Physical Endurance; Sleep; Time Factors; adult; case report; human; male; mental health; mood; motivation; sleep; sleep quality; visual analog scale; wellbeing; wrist; adaptation; affect; anaerobic threshold; athlete; athletic performance; Australia; competitive behavior; cycling; endurance; energy metabolism; oxygen consumption; physical education; physiology; sleep; time factor","","","","","","","El Helou N., Berthelot G., Thibault V., Taflet M., Nassif H., Campion F., Et al., Tour de France, Giro, Vuelta, and classic European races show a unique progression of road cycling speed in the last 20 years, J Sports Sci, 28, pp. 789-796, (2010); Lucia A., Hoyos J., Chicharro J.L., Physiology of professional road cycling, Sports Med, 31, pp. 325-337, (2001); Earnest C.P., Foster C., Hoyos J., Muniesa C.A., Santalla A., Lucia A., Time trial exertion traits of cycling's Grand Tours, Int J Sports Med, 30, pp. 240-244, (2009); Mignon P., The Tour de France and the doping issue, Int J Hist Sport, 20, pp. 227-245, (2003); Van Dongen H.P.A., Maislin G., Mullington J.M., Dinges D.F., The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness:Dose-response effects on neurobehavioral functions and sleep physiology from chronic sleep restriction and total sleep deprivation, Sleep, 26, pp. 117-126, (2003); Dinges D.F., Pack F., Williams K., Gillen K.A., Powell J.W., Ott G.E., Et al., Cumulative sleepiness, mood disturbance and psychomotor vigilance performance decrements during aweek of sleep restricted to 4-5 hours per night, Sleep, 20, pp. 267-277, (1997); Karni A., Tanne D., Rubenstein B.S., Askenasy J.J., Sagi D., Dependence on REM sleep of overnight improvement of a perceptual skill, Science, 265, pp. 679-682, (1994); Weitzman E.D., Circadian rhythms and episodic hormone secretion in man, Annu Rev Med, 27, pp. 225-243, (1976); Dattilo M., Antunes H.K., Medeiros A., Munico Neto M., Souza H.S., Tuik S., Et al., Sleep and muscle recovery: Endocrinological and molecular basis for a new and promising hypothesis, Medl Hypotheses, 77, pp. 220-222, (2011); Halson S., Bridge M.W., Meeusen R., Busschaert B., Gleeson M., Et al., Time course of performance changes and fatigue markers during intensiied training in trained cyclists, J Appl Physiol (1985), 93, pp. 947-956, (2002); Scott J.P.R., McNaughton L.R., Polman R.C.J., Effects of sleep deprivation and exercise on cognitive, motor performance and mood, Physiol Behav, 87, pp. 396-408, (2006); Kahn-Greene E., Killgore D.B., Kamimori G.H., Balkin T.J., Killgore W.D., The effects of sleep deprivation on symptoms of psychopathology in healthy adults, Sleep Med, 8, pp. 215-221, (2007); Friedman L., Brooks J.O., Bliwise D.L., Yesavage J.A., Wicks D.S., Perceptions of life stress and chronic insomnia in older adults, Psychol Aging, 10, (1995); Pinto L.R., Pinto M.C., Goulart L.I., Truksinas E., Rossi M.V., Morin C.M., Et al., Sleep perception in insomniacs, sleep-disordered breathing patients, and healthy volunteers-An important biologic parameter of sleep, Sleep Med, 10, pp. 865-868, (2009); Erlacher D., Ehrlenspiel F., Adegbesan O.A., El-Din H.G., Sleep habits in German athletes before important competitions or games, J Sports Sci, 29, pp. 859-866, (2011); Samuels C., Sleep, recovery, and performance:The new frontier in high-performance athletics, Neurol Clin, 26, pp. 169-180, (2008); Halson S.L., Bartram J., West N., Stephens J., Argus C.K., Driller M.W., Et al., Does hydrotherapy help or hinder adaptation to training in competitive cyclists?, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 46, pp. 1631-1639, (2014); Kushida C.A., Chang A., Gadkary C., Guilleminault C., Carrillo O., Dement W.C., Comparison of actigraphic, polysomnographic, and subjective assessment of sleep parameters in sleep-disordered patients, Sleep Med, 2, pp. 389-396, (2001); Tonetti L., Pasquini F., Fabbri M., Belluzzi M., Natale V., Comparison of two different actigraphs with polysomnography in healthy young subjects, Chronobiol Int, 25, pp. 145-153, (2008); Roach G.D., Schmidt W.F., Aughey R.J., Bourdon P.C., Soria R., Claros J.C., Et al., The sleep of elite athletes at sea level and high altitude: A comparison of sea-level natives and high-altitude natives (ISA3600), Br J Sports Med, 47, pp. i114-i120, (2013); Sargent C., Halson S., Roach G., Sleep or swim?

When cyclist Lance Armstrong confessed to Oprah Winfrey that he used PEDs, his confession came after years of sports journalists framing him as a hero for being a cancer survivor and a Tour de France winner. An analysis of sports journalists’ reactions to Armstrong’s confession show that despite the role sports journalists had perpetuating Armstrong’s hero narrative, sports journalists did not see Armstrong’s fall from grace as threatening to their professional paradigm. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","Altheide D., Qualitative media analysis, (1996); Armstrong L., Jenkins S., It’s not about the bike, (2000); Berkowitz D., Social meanings of news, (1997); Bissinger B., Leave Lance Armstrong alone, The Daily Beast, (2012); Bissinger B., I was deluded to believe Lance Armstrong when he denied doping, The Daily Beast, (2013); Butterworth M.L., Race in “the race”: Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Heroic constructions of whiteness, Critical Studies in Media Communication, 24, 3, pp. 228-244, (2007); Denham B.E., Duke A., Hegemonic masculinity and the rogue warrior: Lance Armstrong as (symbolic) American, Examining identity in sports media, (2010); Gibney A., Marshall F., Tolmach M., Gibney A., The Armstrong Lie, (2013); Hindman E.B., Jayson Blair, The New York Times, and paradigm repair, Journal of Communication, 55, 2, pp. 225-241, (2005); Hindman E.B., Thomas R., Journalism’s “Crazy old aunt”: Helen Thomas and paradigm repair, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 90, 2, pp. 267-286, (2013); Isenberg M.T., John L.

This need is met here by introducing a game (a cyclist race inspired by ‘Le Tour de France’) built around a Student Response System where students are addressed with questions aligned to learning outcomes, which they answer on their own tablets, laptops or smartphones during lectures. Stages take place at selected lecturing slots and for each stage, standings with times are allocated to the students based on the accuracy and speed of their replies. By computing the times of all stages, it is possible to obtain the overall standings. All this info is updated live during and right after each stage. The learning experience is tested in two civil engineering subjects where students’ satisfaction and performance are shown to be significantly enhanced. © 2018, The Author(s).","Active learning; Audience response system;

This paper presents an aerodynamic analysis of 15 different hill descent positions. It is assumed that the hill slope is steep enough so pedaling is not required to gain speed and that the descent does not include sharp bends necessitating changes in position. The analysis is performed by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with the 3D RANS equations and the Transition SST k-ω model. The simulations are validated wind tunnel measurements. The results are analyzed in terms of frontal area, drag area and surface pressure coefficient. It is shown that the infamous “Froome” position during the Peyresourde descent of Stage 8 of the 2016 Tour de France is not aerodynamically superior to several other positions. Other positions are up to 7.2% faster and also safer because they provide more equal distribution of body weight over both wheels. Also several positions that allow larger power generation are aerodynamically superior. © 2018 The Authors","Aerodynamic cyclist drag; Computational fluid dynamics; Cycling aerodynamics; Cycling position; Numerical simulation; Wind tunnel","Aerodynamic drag; Aerodynamics; Wind tunnels; Aerodynamic analysis; Aerodynamic cyclist drag; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Cycling aerodynamic; Cycling position; Frontal areas; Professional cyclists; RANS equation; Surface pressure coefficients; Wind tunnel measurements; Computational fluid dynamics","","","","","NWO Exacte en Natuurwetenschappen; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","An important task of universities nowadays is to communicate their findings to the public.

However, an individual withdrawal may generate external costs that affect people other than the withdrawing individual. As cycling finances increase worldwide, the losses that are incurred due to riders' withdrawals assume a rising importance. Therefore, we test the determinants for professional riders' withdrawals by using probit estimations on nine major races (Le Tour de France, La Vuelta, Il Giro, the Tour de Suisse, the Tour of Poland, the Tour de Picardie, Paris- Nice, Tirreno-Adriatico, and Critérium). Our results recognized that riders withdraw because of a combination of factors, such as individual circumstances (such as a rider's age or a dense body mass index), each race's orography and a low overall placement. These results indicate that teams that seek to minimize this source of losses have to manage riders' expectations, rightly choose the races in which to participate and optimize the team members' interactions with each other. © 2013 West Virginia University.","Cycling; Probit; Withdrawal","","","","","","","","Belloc F., Maruotti A., Petrella L., How individual characteristics affect university students drop-out: A semiparametric mixed-effects model for an Italian case study, Journal of Applied Statistics, 38, pp. 2225-2239, (2011); Brown B., Factors influencing the process of withdrawal by female adolescents from the role of competitive age group swimmer, Sociology of Sport Journal, 2, pp. 111-129, (1985); Cardoso A., Verner D., School drop-out and push-out factors in Brazil: The role of early parenthood, child labor, and poverty, IZA Discussion Papers 2515, (2006); Carter M., Foundations of Mathematical Economics, (2001); Cingano F., Cipollone P., University drop-out the case of Italy.

Among new markers of renal function, neutrophil gelatinase-Associated lipocalin (NGAL) seems to be very promising. It is an early, sensitive and specific marker of acute kidney injury (AKI) with two isoforms: plasma NGAL (pNGAL) and urinary NGAL (uNGAL). The aim of the present study was to assess acute variations in NGAL plasma levels after performing high endurance physical exercise in a group of professional cyclists during the two major European professional cycling competitions (Giro D'Italia and Tour de France). Eighteen professional cyclistis were recruited for the study. A blood sample was collected during rest (after 8 hours fasting) and immediately after the competition (mountain stages) in order to assess the effect of very intense exercise on kidney function by measuring the variations of pNGAL. We also assessed plasma levels of creatinine, creatine-kinase (CK), LDH, transaminases and electrolytes. The results showed that Creatinine, CK and electrolytes levels remained almost stable between rest and post-competition. The levels of transaminases and NGAL showed a mild increase between rest and post-competition, with a significant difference between the two values only for transaminases (p=0.005). However, post-competition values of all investigated variables remained within the physiological range. The results of the present study suggest that even if NGAL values mildly rose after competition, no kidney injury occurred in these highly trained athletes during mountain stages of professional competitions. Other studies in literature confirmed that high endurance physical exercise seems not to cause renal injury in elite athletes. This is probably due to adaptive mechanisms of renal function and to the adaptation to physical stress gained with training. © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.","Acute kidney injury; Cycling; Elite athletes; Plasma NGAL","Acute Kidney Injury; Adult; Athletes; Bicycling; Biomarkers; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Lipocalin-2; Male; Physical Endurance; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; calcium; creatine kinase; creatinine; cyanocobalamin; folic acid; follitropin; gamma glutamyltransferase; glucose; high density lipoprotein; lactate dehydrogenase; luteinizing hormone; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; plasma neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; potassium; sodium; thyrotropin; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; urea; biological marker; LCN2 protein, human; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; calcium blood level; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; competition; creatine kinase blood level; creatinine blood level; cyclist; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; folic acid blood level; follitropin blood level; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; glucose blood level; human; kidney function; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; lipoprotein blood level; luteinizing hormone blood level; male; partial thromboplastin time; potassium blood level; prothrombin time; rest; sodium blood level; thyrotropin blood level; triacylglycerol blood level; urea blood level; vitamin blood level; acute kidney failure; athlete; blood; clinical trial; cycling; endurance; glomerulus filtration rate; physiology","","alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; cyanocobalamin, 53570-76-6, 68-19-9, 8064-09-3; folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; follitropin, 9002-68-0; gamma glutamyltransferase, 85876-02-4; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; thyrotropin, 9002-71-5; urea, 57-13-6; Biomarkers, ; LCN2 protein, human, ; Lipocalin-2, ","","","","","Ronco C., Biomarkers for acute kidney injury: Is NGAL ready for clinical use?, Crit Care, 18, 6, (2014); Haase M., Bellomo R., Devarajan P., Schlattmann P., Haase-Fielitz A., Accuracy of neutrophil gelatinase-Associated lipocalin (NGAL) in diagnosis and prognosis in acute kidney injury: A systematic review and meta-Analysis, Am J Kidney Dis, 54, 6, pp. 1012-1024, (2009); Garrett W.E., Kirkendall D.T., Exercise and Sport Science, (2000); Poortmans J.R., Vanderstraeten J., Kidney function during exercise in healthy and diseased humans, An Update.

Our study sought to assess different strategies for AED deployment. Methods All OHCAs in Paris between 2000 and 2010 were prospectively recorded and geocoded. A guidelines-based strategy of placing an AED in locations where more than one OHCA had occurred within the past five years was compared to two novel strategies: a grid-based strategy with a regular distance between AEDs and a landmark-based strategy. The expected number of AEDs necessary and their median (IQR) distance to the nearest OHCA were assessed for each strategy. Results Of 4176 OHCAs, 1372 (33%) occurred in public settings. The first strategy would result in the placement of 170 AEDs, with a distance to OHCA of 416 (180–614) m and a continuous increase in the number of AEDS. In the second strategy, the number of AEDs and their distance to the closest OHCA would change with the grid size, with a number of AEDs between 200 and 400 seeming optimal. In the third strategy, median distances between OHCAs and AEDs would be 324 m if placed at post offices (n = 195), 239 at subway stations (n = 302), 137 at bike-sharing stations (n = 957), and 142 at pharmacies (n = 1466). Conclusion This study presents an original evidence-based approach to strategies of AED deployment to optimize their number and location. This rational approach can estimate the optimal number of AEDs for any city. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Automated external defibrillator; Cardiac arrest; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Public access defibrillation programs","Aged; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Defibrillators; Electric Countershock; Emergency Medical Services; Evidence-Based Emergency Medicine; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Spatial Interaction; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Paris; Prospective Studies; adult; Article; automated external defibrillator; emergency health service; female; health care access; human; major clinical study; male; out of hospital cardiac arrest; outpatient; priority journal; resuscitation; aged; cardioversion; defibrillator; evidence based emergency medicine; France; gravity model; middle aged; out of hospital cardiac arrest; prospective study; resuscitation; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution","","","","","French Institute of Health and Medical Research; Société Française de Cardiologie, SFC","This work was supported by the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, French Society of Cardiology.

We aimed to determine the effects of rHuEPO treatment in well trained cyclists on maximal, submaximal, and race performance and on safety, and to present a model clinical study for doping research on other substances. Methods We did this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at the Centre for Human Drug Research in Leiden (Netherlands). We enrolled healthy, well trained but non-professional male cyclists aged 18–50 years and randomly allocated (1:1) them to receive abdominal subcutaneous injections of rHuEPO (epoetin β mean dose 6000 IU per week) or placebo (0·9% NaCl) for 8 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by age groups (18–34 years and 35–50 years), with a code generated by a statistician who was not masked to the study. The primary outcome was exercise performance, measured as maximal power output (Pmax), maximal oxygen consumption VO2 max, and gross efficiency in maximal exercise tests with 25 W increments per 5 min, as lactate threshold and ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1) and 2 (VT2) at submaximal levels during the maximal exercise test, and as mean power, VO2, and heart rate in the submaximal exercise tests at the highest mean power output for 45 min in a laboratory setting and in a race to the Mont Ventoux (France) summit, using intention-to-treat analyses. The trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Registry (Nederlands Trial Register), number NTR5643. Findings Between March 7, 2016, and April 13, 2016, we randomly assigned 48 participants to the rHuEPO group (n=24) or the placebo group (n=24). Mean haemoglobin concentration (9·6 mmol/L vs 9·0 mmol/L [estimated difference 0·6, 95% CI 0·4 to 0·8]) and maximal power output (351·55 W vs 341·23 W [10·32, 3·47 to 17·17]), and VO2 max (60·121 mL/min per kg vs 57·415 mL/min per kg [2·707, 0·911 to 4·503]) in a maximal exercise test were higher in the rHuEPO group compared with the placebo group. Submaximal exercise test parameters mean power output (283·18 W vs 277·28 W [5·90, −0·87 to 12·67]) and VO2 (50·288 mL/min per kg vs 49·642 mL/min per kg [0·646, −1·307 to 2·600]) at day 46, and Mont Ventoux race times (1 h 40 min 32 s vs 1 h 40 min 15 s [0·3%, −8·3 to 9·6]) did not differ between groups. All adverse events were grade 1–2 and were similar between both groups. No events of grade 3 or worse were observed. Interpretation Although rHuEPO treatment improved a laboratory test of maximal exercise, the more clinically relevant submaximal exercise test performance and road race performance were not affected. This study shows that clinical studies with doping substances can be done adequately and safely and are relevant in determining effects of alleged performance-enhancing drugs.

This doping scandal marked the end of team-organized doping in professional cycling and ushered in a new period marked by the increasing implementation of anti-doping measures. This article evaluates the impact of the anti-doping rules and tests instituted since the Festina scandal. We adopt a psychosocial approach to analyze the organization of doping and the development of doping attitudes and practices in high-level cycling. Sixteen cyclists were interviewed, of which eight were young, current cyclists and eight were former cyclists who became professionals before the Festina scandal. Our results show that although the fight against doping in the last decade has reduced doping use in high-level cycling, anti-doping measures have also had unexpected effects.

After his battle with testicular cancer, Armstrong made an extraordinarily successful return to cycling, a stunning return that undoubtedly came with consistent accusations of unethical behavior on Armstrong's part. Armstrong went on to break records after his battle with cancer, an accomplishment which also drew unwanted attention and accusations of performance-enhancing drug usage. This study addresses the ethical implications of Lance Armstrong's confession of performance- enhancing drug use during his TdF wins and examines the views of respondents concerning PED use, respondents' views regarding appropriate consequences for athletes accused of PED usage as well as respondents attitudes towards the Lance Armstrong foundation - LIVESTRONG.","","","","","","","","","Alexander B., Why Lance Armstrong's confession should make you worry, Wired, (2013); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior., (1980); Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior, Action-control: From cognition to behavior, pp. 11-39, (1985); Ajzen I., Madden T.J., Prediction of goal-directed behavior: Attitudes, intentions, and perceived behavioral control, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 22, 5, pp. 453-474, (1986); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Arthur B., No sport safe from doping; Turkoglu's positive test rare sight in NBA, National Post, (2013); Benoit W.L., Accounts, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies., (1995); Benoit W.L., Tiger Woods Image Repair: Could he hit one out of the rough?, Repairing the athlete's image: studies in sports image restoration., pp. 89-96, (2012); Black J., Roberts C., Doing ethics in media, (2011); Blaney J.R., Why sports image restoration and how shall we proceed, Repairing the athlete's image: studies in sports image restoration., pp. 89-96, (2012); Boswell T., Amid suspicion, Gonzalez is safe at home, The Washington Post, (2013); Bull A., Ethics: When doctors become part of the problem, then who remains to guard the guardians?, The Guardian, (2013); Coakley J.J., Sport in Society: Issues and Controversies., (1998); Coombs W.T., Ongoing crisis communication: Planning, managing, and responding, (2012); Farmer B.W., Farmer E.I., Burrow J.L., Leading with character, (2008); Sports fans not suspicious of steroid use for record breakers, (2008); Gerlich R.N., Drumheller K., Sollosy M., Kinsky E.S., Controversy, crisis communication and planned giving: The case of Susan G.

The article refers to two main questions. The first concerns bus users: are they actually less likely to be a victim in a road accident than a cyclist, a motorized two-wheeler user or a motorist? Are there differences in the age and gender of the users? The second question concerns third parties involved in bus accidents. Are there differences in risk per mode by age and gender? To address these issues, two indices of exposure were used: distance traveled and time spent on a trip. Accidentology data were obtained from the BACA and travel data from the latest National Transportation and Travel Survey (ENTD). The use of distances traveled for bus passenger accidents made it possible to relativize the low risk of bus users with regard to the users of light vehicle. And the time spent by third parties involved in bus accidents has highlighted the safety issues faced by young people and pedestrians. © IFSTTAR et Éditions NecPlus 2017.","Accident; Bus; Exposure; France; Victim","Buses; Pedestrian safety; Risk assessment; Risk management; Roads and streets; Exposure; France; Light vehicles; Safety issues; Third parties; Travel surveys; Victim; Young peoples; Accidents","","","","","","","Brenac T., Clabaux N., The indirect involvement of buses in traffic accident processes, Safety Sci, 43, pp. 835-843, (2005); Elvik R., Hoye A., Vaa T., Sorensen M., The Handbook of Road Safety Measures, (2009); Beer S., Brenac T., Tramways et sécurité routière, l’expérience des pays germanophones, Transp Environ Circ, 190, pp. 40-46, (2006); Maitre E., Millot M., Clés de lecture piétonne des espaces publics aménagés de tramway: L’influence de l’environnement sensible sur les comportements de traversée, RTS, 29, pp. 255-270, (2013); Bentama A., Khatory A., Étude Statistique Des Risques Du Tramway Rabat-Salé Au Maroc, (2015); Chun Keong Goh K., Currie G., Sarvi M., Logan D., Bus accident analysis of routes with/without bus priority, Accid Anal Prev, 65, pp. 18-27, (2014); Kaplan S., Giacomo Prato C., Risk factors associated with bus accident severity in the United States: A generalized ordered logit model, J Safety Res, 43, pp. 171-180, (2012); Wahlberg A.E., Characteristics of low speed accidents with buses in public transport, Accid Anal Prev, 34, pp. 637-647, (2002); La sécurité routière En France, (2015); Guide De rédaction Du Bulletin d’analyse Des Accidents Corporels De La Circulation (BAAC), (2014); Soe S., ministère De l’Écologie, Du développement Durable, Des Transports Et Du Logement, (2010); Grimal R., Présentation De l’enquête Nationale Transports Et déplacements, pp. 1-8, (2010); Armoogum J., Hubert J.-P., Francois D., Roumier B., Robin M., Roux S., Enquête Nationale Transport Et déplacements 2007-2008, (2011); Chapman R., The concept of exposure, Accid Anal Prev, 5, 2, pp. 95-110, (1973); Risk A., Shaoul J., Exposure to risk and the risk of exposure, Accid Anal Prev, 14, 5, pp. 353-357, (1982); Carroll P.S., Classifications of driving exposure and accident rates for highway safety analysis, Accid Anal Prev, 5, 2, pp. 81-94, (1973); Hauer E., On exposure and accident rate, Traffic Engineering Control, pp. 134-138, (1995); Chipman M.L., Macgregor C.G., Smiley A.M., Lee-Gosselin M., The role of exposure in comparisons of crash risk among different drivers and driving environments, Accid Anal Prev, 25, 2, pp. 207-211, (1993); EU Transport, Incident and Casualty Databases: Current Status and Future Needs, (2001); Koornstra M., Broughton J., Dieleman R., Glansdorp C., Jorgensen N., Taylor F., Et al., Exposure Data for Travel Risk Assesment: Current Practice and Future Needs in the European Union, (1999); Kweon Y.-J., Kockelman K.M., Overall injury risk to different drivers: Combining exposure, frequency, and severity models, Accident Analysis & Prevention, 35, 4, pp. 441-450, (2003); Joly M.F., Joly P., Bergeron J., Desjardins D., Ekoe J.M., Ghadirian P., Et al., Exposure to the risk of traffic accidents, a fundamental epidemiological parameter, and one difficult to measure, Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique 39(3), pp. 307-313, (1991); Wolfe A.C., The concept of exposure to the risk of a road traffic accident and an overview of exposure data collection methods, Accid Anal Prev, 14, 5, pp. 337-340, (1982); Dionne G., Desjardins D., Laberge-Nadeau C., Maag U., Medical conditions, risk exposure, and truck drivers’ accidents: An analysis with count data regression models, Accid.

This systematic review aims to identify whether the physical activity environment varies by socio-economic position (SEP), which may contribute to socio-economic patterning of physical activity behaviours, and in turn, obesity levels. Six databases were searched. Studies were included if they compared an objectively measured aspect of the physical activity environment between areas of differing SEP in a high-income country. Two independent reviewers screened all papers. Results were classified according to the physical activity environment analysed: walkability/bikeability, green space, and recreational facilities. Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. A greater number of positive compared with negative associations were found between SEP and green space, whereas there were marginally more negative than positive associations between SEP and walkability/bikeability and recreational facilities. A high number of mixed and null results were found across all categories. With a high number of mixed and null results, clear socio-economic patterning in the presence of physical activity environments in high-income countries was not evident in this systematic review. Heterogeneity across studies in the measures used for both SEP and physical activity environments may have contributed to this result. © 2019 World Obesity Federation","obesity; physical activity environment; socio-economic position","Environment; Exercise; Health Promotion; Humans; Obesity; Socioeconomic Factors; Australia; baseball; basketball; bikeability; Canada; environmental health; football; France; Germany; golf; human; New Zealand; physical activity; physical inactivity; Review; Scotland; social status; swimming; systematic review; United States; walkability; environment; exercise; health promotion; obesity; physiology; socioeconomics","","","","","Western Alliance, (APP1041020); Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, FNIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (APP1114118)","Funding text 1: M.N. has received grants from National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), grants from National Institutes for Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (USA).; Funding text 2: C.S. and S.A. are investigators on a NHMRC Partnership Project titled “Whole of system trial of prevention strategies for childhood obesity: WHO STOPS childhood obesity” (APP1114118), which also receives funding support from the Western Alliance.

Other ways of reporting are needed to keep the viewer interested. In this paper, two possible solutions are proposed that have been evaluated during the Grand Depart of the Tour de France 2019 in Brussels. The first innovation focuses on data-driven summarization and allows end-users to query for personalized stories of a race, tailored to their wishes (such as the length of the clip and the teams and/or riders that they are interested in).

Both rich, interactive TV experiences are based on a combination of data mining and computer vision techniques which can also be applied to other sports with similar characteristics.

On the large scale, it concerns interconnecting cities and metropolises, and, on a smaller scale, it refers to connection networks for pedestrians, cyclists and other means of public transport. The study aims to assess the importance of sustainable transport as a principle of New Urbanism in contemporary redevelopment projects. It introduces possible ways of implementing these principles, as well as dangers coming from misunderstanding them. The approaches and methods used in this article combine field studies conducted during the research trips, desk research and interviews with professionals at various stages of two urban renewal projects – Clichy Batignolles (France) and the main train station area in Lodz (Poland). The study revealed the strategic role of rail line redevelopment projects in both rebuilding the continuity of the urban fabric (Clichy Batignolles) and in creating a new centrality for an area with attractive cultural activities and services (Lodz). As urban project timeframes are often long, both case studies show that high flexibility and the ability to adapt investments to changing conditions are often required. Nevertheless, the realization of the key infrastructure elements should be maintained all along. Furthermore, functional diversity can provide an important support for the sustainability of the project as it ensures the quality of urban tissue through height level representative public projects, thereby giving the area in question a new image. As exemplified by the housing policy in France, the distribution of functions can also serve as a pertinent response to the strategic needs of the entire agglomeration as well as a useful solution to local problems. One of the most crucial elements of redevelopment projects is the implementation of sustainable transportation that provides quick and comfortable connections by various means of public transport within different urban scales: metropolises, cities, districts and the city. As an element of sustainable urban policy, an effective public transportation network in the inner city should be supported by the limitation of car park ratio for non-residents within the redevelopment project. Altogether, the impact that other New Urbanism principles exert on developing urban structures is a pertinent question. Today, the real challenge for this movement has moved into the city, rather than on the outskirts, as in the past. © 2019, Editura Universitatii din Bucuresti.

Quite interestingly, Armstrong also recalled all the doping controls he managed to circumvent during his career in professional cycling. Shortly after Armstrong’s admission of doping, WADA’s then President John Fahey declared the need for an even more intensive “war on drugs” in sports, and made the statement used as an opening quote of this chapter. Both Armstrong and Fahey seem to agree on this: Athletes (and/or their entourage) can find ways to circumvent doping controls. This raises questions about the efficacy and effectiveness of the existing anti-doping policies and methods, and also calls for attention to alternative doping prevention methods. The present chapter will discuss how and why state-of-the-art doping controls may not meet their targets, why a paradigm shift in doping prevention is needed, and how doping prevention interventions can be informed and developed based on the most recent scientific evidence about the “psychology of doping use” in sports. © 2016 V.

This implies that residents in Lorraine can choose between a large set of forests if they decide to visit a forest. The abundance of forests in Lorraine makes identification of the visited forests difficult. To facilitate identification of forests actually visited, we have incorporated an interactive map in a Web-based survey intended to include both revealed and stated preference data. We compare different sampling schemes to define the choice set used for site selection modelling when the actual choice set considered is potentially large and unknown to the analyst. Easy access to forests also implies that around half of the visitors walk or bike to the forest. We apply an error-component mixed-logit model to simultaneously model the travel mode decision and the site selection decision and to combine revealed and stated preference data. Finally, the effect on the willingness-to-pay of changes in forest quality and access is evaluated based on alternative choice set specifications, model specifications and data sources (revealed and stated preference data). © 2014 Journal of Environmental Economics and Policy Ltd.","choice experiment; choice set; error-component mixed logit; site selection; travel cost method; travel mode choice","","","","","","Pôle de Compétences FABELOR; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-11-LABX-0002-01); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Alimentation","This work was supported by the French Ministry of Agriculture in the framework of the Pôle de Compétences FABELOR and The UMR 357 Economie Forestiére is supported by a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the “Investissements d'Avenir” program (ANR-11-LABX-0002-01, Lab of Excellence ARBRE).

Kidney injuries after trauma have been well described. However, there exists a paucity of data on other traumatic GUI after traffic accidents. The objective of this study was to analyze the frequency and type of all GUI, by user category, after traffic accidents. METHODS: Patient cases were extracted from the trauma registry of the French department of Rhone from 1996 to 2013. We assessed the urogenital injuries presented by each of road user's categories. Severity injuries were coded with the Abbreviated Injury Scale and the Injury Severity Score. Kidney trauma was mapped with the classification of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Multivariate prediction models were used for analysis of data. RESULTS: Of 162,690 victims, 963 presented with GUI (0.59%). 47% were motorcyclists, 22% were in a car, 18% on bicycles, and 9% were pedestrians. The most common organ injury was kidney (41%) followed by testicular (23%). Among the 208 motorists with a GUI, kidney (70%), bladder (10%), and adrenal gland (9%) were the most frequent lesions. Among the 453 motorcyclist victims with GUI, kidney (35%) and testicular (38%) traumas were the most frequent and 62% of injuries involved external genitalia. There were 175 cyclists with GUI, 70% of injuries involved external genitalia; penile traumas (23%) were the most frequent. In total, there were 395 kidney injuries, most being low grade. According to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma kidney injuries were grade I, 59%; grade II, 11%; grade III, 16%; grade IV, 9%; grade V, 3%; and indeterminate, 2%. CONCLUSION: GUI is an infrequent trauma after traffic accidents, with kidneys being the most commonly injured. Physicians must maintain a high awareness for external genitalia injuries in motorcyclists and cyclists. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Since 1954 it has systematically extended its appeal beyond France’s national borders, regularly staging a grand départ from other European cities. The Tour de France also attracts an estimated 12 million spectators lining the route over the race’s 3-week duration every year, is watched by a reputed 1.5 billion global television audience across more than 188 countries and, therefore, is implicitly involved in a complex production of transnational discourses about sport. This article analyzes the 2014 ESPN documentary Slaying the Badger and proposes a reading which situates the representation of Greg LeMond (the first and, to date, only officially recognized American to win the Tour de France) and his turbulent rivalry with teammate and mentor French cyclist Bernard Hinault within wider social contexts. Focusing on the discourse of “Americanization,” the article also critically examines the meanings of socioeconomic forces that began to transform not only the international composition of the peloton but also the cultural significance of the Tour de France from the 1980s onward. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","le Tour de France; professional cycling; sport and globalization; sport and identity; sport and media; sport and nationhood; sports documentary film","","","","","","","","Bairner A., Sport, nationalism and globalization, (2001); Barrington B., Sports Film: The Games People Play, (2014); Breckon M., Le Film Du Tour, Rouleur, pp. 60-173, (2014); Carr P., Lance Armstrong and George W.

Or do you remember teaching someone to learn how to ride a bike? Learning to ride a bike or teaching someone to ride a bike is an iterative process where the learner wants to “experiment” too quickly and the teacher tries to impart his/her wisdom so the learner does not make the same mistakes that his/her did. In the end, the learner probably had to repeat many of the same mistakes; and most importantly, no one would have pronounced one of the early experiences as a failure because the learner was not ready to ride in the Tour de France. Learning to teach Project-Based Learning (PBL) effectively requires that an individual practice some of the patience and techniques required to teach someone to ride a bike, patience to allow the learner to take control and become more experienced in the techniques that build upon the expanding experience and knowledge base as a catalyst for accelerated learning. Just as learning to ride a bike - or learning to let the learner learn on his/her own - is not an all or nothing process, learning to learn in a PBL environment and learning to teach in a PBL environment are not all or nothing propositions. © 2013 Sense Publishers.","Conceptual Understanding;

It postulates the necessity of equilibrium between the teams in a league in order to guarantee uncertainty of outcome and thus generate public demand. By contrast, performances and competitive balance are not easy to define in road cycling. This is because cycling can be seen as a team sport but the global team performance usually is of minor importance or even not taken into account at all. A large proportion of cyclists are in support of another rider, meaning that they do not care about their personal result but instead try to help their team leader(s). Moreover, a team leader generally has one specific objective amongst a range of possible ones. This chapter deals with the complex issue of modeling performances and competitive balance in professional road cycling. After a brief review of the literature on modeling performances and competitive balance in cycling, an innovative measure is introduced: competitive intensity in cycling. We illustrate this measure with two stages of the 2013 and 2014 Tour de France, and we discuss its implications. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Soon after the sudden rupture of a strand near the anchorage, the bridge was closed to traffic. Inspections were conducted to understand the causes of this event and to assess the strength of cables and strand sockets. Before the bridge was rehabilitated, its safety was improved through the strengthening of each socket. The bridge was then reopened to pedestrians and cyclists only. An acoustic emission system was installed over the course of a year. Events related to cable ruptures were monitored accordingly. Meanwhile, several other experimental investigations were conducted on steel and concrete materials (i.e., resilience, tensile steel strength, carbonation, chloride ingress) to estimate the residual structural service life of the bridge and to plan repair actions. A major rehabilitation program was then scheduled to change all of the cables and sockets. This paper presents stages of the investigation and the rehabilitation process.","","Acoustic emission testing; Cable stayed bridges; Acoustic emission systems; Chloride ingress; Concrete materials; Damage characterization; Experimental investigations; Present stage; Rehabilitation projects; Steel materials; Steel strength; Tensile steels; Chlorine compounds","","","","","","","Houel A., Gonod B., Le Teil Bridge: Detailed Inspection, (2009); Dierkens M., Le Teil Bridge: Diagnosis of the Concrete Condition, (2009); Structural Analysis Software, (2004); Finite Element Software, (2014); Miner M.A., Cumulative damage in fatigue, Journal of Applied Mechanics, 67, pp. A159-A164, (1945); Germain D., Le Teil Bridge: Fatigue Study of the Deck, Bridge Robustness, and Fatigue Crack Propagation, (2009); Paris P., Erdogan F., A critical analysis of crack propagation laws, Journal of Basic Engineering, 85, pp. 528-534, (1963); Tessier C., Le Teil Bridge: Investigation and Surveillance after Cable Rupture (In French), (2007); Houel A., Orcesi A., Leconte R., Bridge characterization and structural health monitoring: A suspension bridge case study, Bridge Maintenance, Safety, Management, Resilience, and Sustainability: Proceedings of the Sixth International IABMAS Conference, Stresa, Lake Maggiore, Italy, 2012, pp. 2152-2159, (2012)","C.F.

François Mitterrand, Case24, France, Université Lyon 1, F-69373 Lyon, France","Bicycles are an alternative means of transport, promoted for health benefits. However, cycling is risky. In France the annual incidence of cycling injuries is estimated at 70 per 100,000. Most existing cycling safety studies are based on police data, which is inappropriate to cyclist safety research, being biased as to accident type (single vs. multi-vehicle crash) and recording as much as 10 times fewer cyclists than a road trauma registry for the same geographical area. The present study therefore used a postal survey sent to victims injured while cycling in 2009-2011 and identified in a road trauma registry. The survey sample comprised 1,078 injured cyclists. This article presents the construction of a Typology of Bicycle Crashes. A multifactorial approach is adopted with the Partitioning Around Medoids algorithm. Seventeen crash configurations compose the typology (7 utilitarian trips, 3 leisure rides and 7 sport practices), with 35 variables; the most discriminatory variables were ""collide with another road user"", ""commutes"", ""practices sport"" and ""aged 60 and over"". Each accident configuration is described by the proportion of its main characteristics in comparison with that in the overall sample.

However, Council has been constrained from achieving this by carriageway width requirements for contra-flow lanes and a demand for on-street parking that makes these lanes politically difficult to achieve. A recent attempt to tackle this issue acknowledged from the outset that formal contra-flow lanes were problematic to achieve. Instead, a brief review of international research was undertaken as the basis of understanding and addressing the risk associated with enabling contra-flow cycling without contraflow bicycle lanes. The results may be surprising. The most significant study undertaken found that enabling contra-flow cycling in quiet one-way streets, using 'bicycles excepted' signage and without formal contra-flow lanes, reduces rather than increases the overall crash risk for cyclists. Other studies were hampered by very low crash numbers in quiet one-way streets but found no evidence of increased crash risk. This paper presents the evidence for a simple, inexpensive means of improving cycling convenience and safety in urban conditions where traffic speeds are low (85th percentile speeds no higher than 40 km/h). Noting the difficulty or reluctance of European municipalities in adopting this measure - experience that has led to cyclist contra-flow using 'bicycles excepted' signage becoming mandatory in 30 km/h and 50 km/h zones in Belgium and in 30 km/h zones in France - this paper further discusses the role of a risk management methodology in applying new and innovative treatments to Australia conditions. This paper does not present design practice and guidance, but all proposed contra-flow locations should be reviewed and any site-specific safety issues addressed. The list of references includes document sources for the reference of readers seeking design guidance.","","Bicycles; Risk assessment; Risk management; Safety engineering; Sporting goods; Design guidance; Design practice; Inexpensive means; International researches; Management methodologies; On-street parking; Strategic objectives; Urban conditions; Buoyancy","","","","","","","Integrated Movement Strategy, (1999); Alrutz D., Angenendt W., Draeger W., Gundel D., Verkehrssicherheit in Einbahnstraen Mit Gegengerichtetem Radverkehr (Traffic Safety on One-way Streets with Contraflow Bicycle Traffic), (2002); Guide to Engineering Practice Part 14-Bicycles, (1999); Managing Asset Management Related Civil Liability Risk, (2012); Contra-flow Cycling, CTC Briefing Note, Cyclists' Touring Club, (2012); Traffic Advisory Leaflet 6/98 Contraflow Cycling, (1998); Signing the Way: Traffic Signs Policy Paper, (2011); Adelaide City Strategic Bicycle Plan, (1995); Contra-Flow Cycling Introduced, (2012); Dupriez B., Contraflow Cycling in Belgium and the Brussels Region, (2009); Department for Transport to Make Cycling Contraflows Easier to Create, London Cycling Campaign, (2011); Ministerieel Rondschrijven Betreffende de Toepassing Van Het Beperkt Eénrichtingsverkeer, (1998); No Entry Except Cycles Signing Review, (2010); Australian Road Rules 6th Amendment Package Regulatory Impact Statement, National Transport Commission, (2007); Patterson F., Against the flo w: The evidence for contra-flow cycling, Proceedings of the Fifth Australian Cycling Conference, (2013); Populer M., Dupriez B., Markering en Signalisatie Van Beperkt Eenrichtingsverkeer, (2006); Strategic Bicycle Plan 2003 Volume 1: The Strategy, for Adelaide City Council, (2003); Reid S., Adams S., Infrastructure and Cyclist Safety, (2010); Two-Way Cycling, (2012)","","","ARRB Transport Research Ltd.","","","","","","10375783","","RTRRE","","English","Road Transp Res","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84911104420"

Whereas traditional approaches to predicting individuals' performance focus on differences between individuals, a considerable proportion of variability in performance is attributable to within-person sources. However, we submit that within-person variability in performance may also be attributable to the fact that people work in different contexts. Moreover, individual performance is often the result of unrecognized team contributions. Accordingly, we advance a Human Capital Resource Complementarity (HCRC) theory to explain the alignment of human capital resources with dynamic situational features, and to illustrate the influence of team collective competencies on the performance of individual members. We then empirically test HCRC theory- derived hypotheses using a sample of 169 cyclists from 22 teams across 18 stages of the centennial Tour de France. Our results suggest that individuals' specific competencies interact with situational characteristics to predict their performance variability over time, beyond that accounted for by their general competencies. Moreover, these effects are accentuated to the extent that teammates' competencies aligned with individual competencies in a given situation. Implications for future theory building, research, and practice are discussed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Competencies; Interactionism; Multilevel; Performance; Situational attributes","Adult; Athletic Performance; Group Processes; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Psychological Theory; Work Performance; adult; article; cyclist; France; human; athletic performance; group process; human relation; job performance; male; psychological theory; psychology","","","","","","","Aguinis H., O'Boyle E., Star performers in twenty-first century organizations, Personnel Psychology, 67, pp. 313-350, (2014); Aguinis H., Werner S., Abbott J.L., Angert C., Park J.H., Kohlhausen D., Customer-centric science: Reporting significant research results with rigor, relevance, and practical impact in mind, Organizational Research Methods, 13, pp. 515-539, (2010); Alvares K.M., Hulin C.L., Two explanations of temporal changes in ability-skill relationships: A literature review and theoretical analysis, Human Factors, 14, pp. 295-308, (1972); Ancona D.G., Okhuysen G.A., Perlow L.A., Taking time to integrate temporal research, Academy of Management Review, 26, pp. 512-529, (2001); Baltes P.B., On the incomplete architecture of human ontogeny.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) performed in athletes may manifest abnormalities, including repolarization alterations. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of T-wave morphology features in athletes. Methods Eighty male elite athletes, consisting of 40 Tour de France cyclists (age 27 ± 5 years), 40 soccer players (age 26 ± 6 years) and 40 healthy men (age 27 ± 5 years) were included. Results Sinus bradycardia, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, incomplete right bundle branch block and early repolarization were documented in 25 %, 20%, 13% and 14% of athletes, respectively. ECG criteria for LV hypertrophy in 12-lead ECG were more common in cyclists (35%) than in soccer players (5%), P < 0.0001. Cyclists and soccer players had significantly longer RR interval, and repolarization features than the control group. Conclusions T-wave morphology of athletes is different from non-athletes, depending of the sport.

In a first segment, we examine the rebirth of bicycle usage in France, the role of bike-sharing schemes and the pro-bicycle policies in France, especially the “Plan National Vélo” announced in September 2018. In a second part, we examine the concept of Cycling Mobility Plans in France and the design issues of bike path networks. Finally, in the case of the three Burgundy areas, we look at the difficulties to implement a true bicycling network: financial costs, lack of interest from periurban municipal governements dominated by car users and farmers. Local politics interfere with the bike path planning, as well as the lack of coordination between national goals and local realities. © 2010 23th International Conference on Architecture of Computing Systems 2010, ARCS 2010 - Workshop Proceedings.

With the analysis of a French media corpus (press and TV channel), we were able to better understand how they interact with the other actors of the ecosystem of the cycling performance: (1) the scientific experts who are at the beginning of the controversy, (2) the cyclists and the teams who defend themselves after the firsts attacks, and (3) the other media and journalists who take part in the controversy. The study shows that to be legitimate in the ecologic system of cycling, actors need some specific ‘symbolic capital’ (Bourdieu, 1994). At the same time, to be legitimate in the controversy, they have to find a global recognition of their symbolic capital to have a discourse with authority and to be considered as the trustworthiest. Hence, as the media possess the power of the visibility, they played a key role in the controversy and modified the cycling ecology. They are able to act on the confidence relationships between the ‘audience’ (Abbott, 1988) by building the reputation of actors. They give visibility to the ‘devices of confidence’ (Quéré, 2011) that are a basis of information on which people can rely to build their judgment. Finally, the media reaffirm their position and editorial line, more or less critical and investigative, in order to satisfy their readership and preserve their specific symbolical capital in the media field. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Bertrand Fincoeur, John Gleaves and Fabien Ohl; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Abbott A., The System of Professions.

Our model is based upon a series of incline planes and incorporates real stage data and cyclist power output, as well as air and rolling resistances. We report on our most recent model modification in which we utilized allometric scaling to adjust our model cyclist's power output based upon varied rider masses for different stage types. We also provide a comparison between our model and published power data for top level cyclists and recent Tour de France winners such as Chris Froome and Vincenzo Nibali. This juxtaposition showcases not only how well our model predicts stage-winning times, but also the extent to which our model matches reality.

Methods and results Characteristics and vital status of all French participants in the Tour de Francewere collected for the 1947-2012 period. Causes of deathwere obtained from 1968. Overall and disease-specific mortalitieswere compared with the French male population using overall and specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among the 786 French cyclists who participated at least once between 1947 and 2012, 208 (26%) died by 1 September 2012. Neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases accounted for61%of deaths.We observed a41%lowermortality in French cyclists (SMR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.51-0.68, P < 0.0001), which did not change over time (P = 0.70). Itwas observed for main mortality causes: for neoplasms (SMR: 0.56;95%CI: 0.42-0.72, P < 0.0001) and for cardiovascular death (SMR: 0.67;95% CI: 0.50-0.88, P = 0.004), except mortality related to external causes (SMR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.71-1.53, P = 0.80). Conclusion We observed a substantially and significantly lower mortality in participants in the Tour de France, compared with the general male population. However, our results do not allow us to assess in detail the balance between positive effects of high-level sports activity and selection of healthy elite athletes, vs. any potential deleterious effects of excessive physical exercise or alleged doping. © The Author 2013.","Athletes; Cardiovascular; Cycling; Doping; Mortality","Adult; Bicycling; Cohort Studies; France; Humans; Longevity; Male; Mortality; Young Adult; Athletes; Cardiovascular; Cycling; Doping; Mortality; adult; article; cancer mortality; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cause of death; controlled study; cycling; digestive system disease; doping; endocrine disease; endurance sport; France; human; infection; male; mental disease; mortality; musculoskeletal disease; neoplasm; neurologic disease; nutritional disorder; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; urogenital tract disease","","","","","","","Tour De France 2013, (2013); Paffenbarger Jr. R.S., Hyde R.T., Wing A.L., Hsieh C.C., Physical activity, all-cause mortality, and longevity of college alumni, N Engl J Med, 314, pp. 605-613, (1986); Berlin J.A., Colditz G.A., Ameta-Analysis of physical activity in the prevention of coronary heart disease, Am J Epidemiol, 132, pp. 612-628, (1990); Haskell W.L., Lee I.M., Pate R.R., Powell K.E., Blair S.N., Franklin B.A., Macera C.A., Heath G.W., Thompson P.D., Bauman A., Physical activity and public health: Updated recommendation for adults from the american college of sports medicine and the american heart association, Circulation, 116, pp. 1081-1093, (2007); Wen C.P., Wai J.P., Tsai M.K., Yang Y.C., Cheng T.Y., Lee M.C., Chan H.T., Tsao C.K., Tsai S.P., Wu X., Minimum amount of physical activity for reduced mortality and extended life expectancy: A prospective cohort study, Lancet, 378, pp. 1244-1253, (2011); Schnohr P., Marott J.L., Lange P., Jensen G.B., Longevity in male and female joggers: The copenhagen city heart study, Am J Epidemiol, 177, pp. 683-689, (2013); Benito B., Gay-Jordi G., Serrano-Mollar A., Guasch E., Shi Y., Tardif J.C., Brugada J., Nattel S., Mont L., Cardiac arrhythmogenic remodeling in a rat model of long-Term intensive exercise training, Circulation, 123, pp. 13-22, (2010); Schnohr P., Longevity and causes of death in male athletic champions, Lancet, 298, pp. 1364-1366, (1971); Teramoto M., Bungum T.J., Mortality and longevity of elite athletes, J Sci Med Sport, 13, pp. 410-416, (2010); Sanchis-Gomar F., Olaso-Gonzalez G., Corella D., Gomez-Cabrera M.C., Vina J., Increased average longevity among the 'tour de france' cyclists, Int J Sports Med, 32, pp. 644-647, (2011); El Helou N., Berthelot G., Thibault V., Tafflet M., Nassif H., Campion F., Hermine O., Toussaint J.F., Tour de france giro vuelta and classic european races show a unique progression of road cycling speed in the last 20 years, J Sports Sci, 28, pp. 789-796, (2010); Lucia A., Earnest C., Arribas C., The tourde france: A physiological review, Scand JMed Sci Sports, 13, pp. 275-283, (2003); Coyle D., What he's been pedaling, The New York Times [Internet], (2006); Padilla S., Mujika I., Santisteban J., Impellizzeri F.M., Goiriena J.J., Exercise intensity and load during uphill cycling in professional 3-week races, Eur J Appl Physiol, 102, pp. 431-438, (2008); Lentillon-Kaestner V., The development of doping use in high-level cycling: From team-organized doping to advances in the fight against doping, Scand J Med Sci Sports, 23, pp. 189-197, (2013); Parssinen M., Kujala U., Vartiainen E., Sarna S., Seppala T., Increased premature mortality of competitive powerlifters suspected to have used anabolic agents, Int J Sports Med, 21, pp. 225-227, (2000); Marchand J.-L., Generating person-years and calculating smr using sas: A simple program for exact calculations, Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique, 58, pp. 370-374, (2010); Liddell F.D., Simple exact analysis of the standardised mortality ratio, J Epidemiol Community Health, 38, pp. 85-88, (1984); Deligiannis A., Bjornstad H., Carre F., Heidbuchel H., Kouidi E., Panhuyzen-Goedkoop N.M., Pigozzi F., Schanzer W., Vanhees L., Esc study group of sports cardiology position paper on adverse cardiovascular effects of doping in athletes, Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil, 13, pp. 687-694, (2006); Leon A.S., Connett J., Jacobs Jr. D.R., Rauramaa R., Leisure-Time physical activity levels and risk of coronary heart disease and death, JAMA, 258, pp. 2388-2395, (1987); Pate R.R., Pratt M., Blair S.N., Haskell W.L., Macera C.A., Bouchard C., Buchner D., Ettinger W., Heath G.W., King A.C., Kriska A., Leon A.S., Marcus B.H., Morris J., Paffenbarger R.S., Patrick K., Pollock M.L., Rippe J.M., Sallis J., Wilmore J.H., Physical activity and public health.

While many studies have analyzed physical and sporting activities among young people, and adults, the practices of children remain a blind spot. The experience of children growing up in impoverished areas, however, deserves a specific look, especially regarding their relationship with public space. From this perspective, we studied scientific literature that emphasizes the independent mobility and family constraints of girls in particular. Objectives: Our approach questions gendered relationships with public space in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods and the use of bicycles by children between the ages of nine and ten. Methodology: A team of sociologists and geographers followed six CM1classes in three primary schools located in some of Strasbourg's more socially disadvantaged neighborhoods. For two of these groups, these children received specific training from municipal sports educators and from road safety educators. The third school served as a control group. Ad hoc questionnaires were sent to each school, before and after the bike learning courses, to study the development of their technical levels, their use of the bicycle in the neighborhoods and around the city, their cycling related relationships with friends and family. Results: The results highlight a clear, gendered, and persistent differentiation, in terms of bike control, technical ease (in and out of their neighborhood) and the weight of a distinct socialization regarding gender related risks and family relationships. Conclusions: For these children, there exists a persistent and specific use of public space when it comes to cycling and this division is essentially related to the gendered relational configuration of working class families. Contribution: This study looks at how cycling is learned and it identifies the precautions taken when promoting cycling among boys and girls in public spaces. The promotion of cycling is essential for the purposes of travel, especially in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods. © 2018 Centre - Urbanisation Culture Societe de l'INRS.","Child; Cycling; Economic inequalities; Gender; Neighborhood; Physical activity; Public space; Social inqualities","","","","","","","","Bacque M.-H., Fol S., L'inégalité face à la mobilité: du constat à l'injonction, Revue Suisse de Sociologie, 33, 1, pp. 89-104, (2007); Carver A., Timperio A., Hesketh K., Crawford D., Are children and adolescents less active if parents restrict their physical activity and active transport du perceived risk, Social Science and Medicine, 70, 11, pp. 1799-1805, (2010); Carver A., Timperio A.F., Crawford D.A., Bicycles gathering dust rather than raising dust - Prevalence and predictors of cycling among Australian schoolchildren, Journal of Science & Medicine in Sport, 18, 5, pp. 540-544, (2015); Christie N., Kimberlee R., Towner E., Rodgers S., Heather W., Sleney J., Lyons R., Children aged 9-14 living in disadvantaged areas in England: Opportunities and barriers for cycling, Journal of Transport Geography, 19, 4, pp. 943-949, (2011); Charreire H., Environnement géographique et pratique d'activité physique, Dans Coll., Nutrition, Activités Physiques et Inégalités Sociales, pp. 359-385, (2014); Clair I., Les Jeunes et l'Amour dans les Cités, (2008); De Meester F., Van Dyck D., De Bourdeaudhuij I., Cardon G., Parental perceived neighborhood attributes: associations with active transport and physical activity among 10-12 year children and the mediating role of independent mobility, BMC Public Health, 14, 1, pp. 31-35, (2014); Di Meo G., Éléments de réflexion pour une géographie sociale du genre: le cas des femmes dans la ville, L'Information Géographique, 76, 2, pp. 72-94, (2012); Donnat O., Les pratiques culturelles des Français à l'ère du numérique, Culture Etudes, 5, pp. 1-12, (2009); Ducheyne F., De Bourdeaudhuij I., Spittaels H., Cardon G., Individual, social and physical environmental correlates of 'never' and 'always' cycling to school among 10 to 12 year old children living within a 3.0 km distance from school, Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act, 9, 10, pp. 129-142, (2012); Ducheyne F., De Bourdeaudhuij I., Lenoir M., Cardon G., Does a cycle training course improve cycling skills in children?, Accid Anal Prev, 59, pp. 38-45, (2013); Ducheyne F., De Bourdeaudhuij I., Lenoir M., Cardon G., Effects of a cycle training course on children's cycling skills and levels of cycling to school, Accid Anal Prev, 67, pp. 49-60, (2014); Elias N., La Société des Individus, (1990); Esteban, Etude de Santé sur l'Environnement, la Biosurveillance, l'Activité Physique et la Nutrition, (2017); Fere C., Concilier Accès À la Mobilité pour Tous et Mobilité Durable. la Prise en Compte des Inégalités d'Accès À la Mobilité dans les Politiques Urbaines de l'Agglomération Lyonnaise, Thèse de Doctorat en Urbanisme et Aménagement, (2011); Gaboriau P., Les trois âges du vélo en France, Vingtième Siècle, Revue d'Histoire, 29, pp. 17-34, (1991); Ghekiere A., Carver A., Veitch J., Salmon J., Deforche B., Timperio A., Does parental accompaniment when walking or cycling moderate the association between physical neighbourhood environment and active transport among 10-12 year olds?, Journal of Science & Medicine in Sport, 19, 2, pp. 149-153, (2016); Guerandel C., Le Sport Fait Mâle. la Fabrique des Filles et des Garçons dans les Cités, (2016); Heran F., Le Retour de la Bicyclette.

They aim to give insight into the underlying urban phenomena linked to city dynamics and generally rely on data-mining tools to extract meaningful patterns from the huge volume of data recorded by such complex systems. This paper presents one such tool through the introduction of a family of generative models based on Poisson mixtures to automatically analyse and find temporal-based clusters in Origin/Destination flow-data. Such an approach may provide latent factors that reveal how regions of different usage interact over time. More generally, the proposed methodology can be used to cluster edges of temporal valued-graphs with respect to their temporal profiles and is thus particularly suited to mine patterns in dynamic Origin/Destination matrices commonly encountered in the field of transport. An in-depth analysis of the results of the proposed models was carried out on two months of trips data recorded on the Vélib' Bike-Sharing System of Paris to validate the approach. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Count time series clustering; Dynamic Origin/Destination matrix; Generative model-based clustering; Human mobility analysis; Urban mining; Vélib' bike sharing system","Bicycles; Mixtures; Dynamic origin/destination matrixes; Human mobility; Model-based clustering; Sharing systems; Time series clustering; accuracy; algorithm; article; cluster analysis; comparative study; data analysis; data mining; expectation maximization algorithm; France; histogram; linear system; Poisson mixture model; prediction; priority journal; statistical model; urban area; validation study; Matrix algebra","","","","","","","Bagchi M., White P., The potential of public transport smart card data, Transp.

Design Prospective follow-up study. Methods The cohort was composed of 1168 victims of road traffic accidents, aged ≥16 years. Two years after the accident, 912 victims completed a self-administered questionnaire. Weighted logistic regression models were implemented to compare casualties still reporting impact related to the accident versus those reporting no residual impact. Five outcomes were analysed: unrecovered health status, impact on occupation or studies, on familial or affective life, on leisure or sport activities and but also the financial difficulties related to the accident. Results 46.1% of respondents were motorised four-wheel users, 29.6% motorised two-wheel (including quad) users, 13.3% pedestrians (including inline skate and push scooter users) and 11.1% cyclists. 53.3% reported unrecovered health status, 32.0% persisting impact on occupation or studies, 25.2% on familial or affective life, 46.9% on leisure or sport activities and 20.2% still had accident-related financial difficulties. Type of user, adjusted on age and gender, was linked to unrecovered health status and to impact on leisure or sport activities. When global severity (as measured by NISS) was integrated in the previous model, type of user was also associated with impact on occupation or studies. Type of user was further associated with impact on occupation or studies and on leisure or sport activities when global severity and the sociodemographic data obtained at inclusion were taken into account. It was not, however, related to any of the outcomes studied here, when the models focused on the injured body region. Finally, type of road user did not seem, on the various predictive models, to be related to financial difficulties due to the accident or to impact on familial or affective life. Conclusions Overall, victims were affected by their accident even 2 years after it occurred. The severity of lesions induced by the accident was the main predictive factor. However, considering lesion as intermediary factors between the accident and the recovery status at 2 year post-accident, impact on health status was lower for cyclists than M4W users or M2W users. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Adult; Cohort study; ESPARR; France; Road accident; Two years' follow-up","Abbreviated Injury Scale; Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Cohort Studies; Cost of Illness; Employment; Female; Follow-Up Studies; France; Health Status; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Leisure Activities; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Recovery of Function; Sex Factors; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult; Employment; Health; Highway accidents; Regression analysis; Sports; Wheels; Adult; Cohort studies; ESPARR; France; Two years' follow-up; adolescent; adult; age; cohort analysis; convalescence; cost of illness; economics; employment; female; follow up; France; health status; human; injury scale; leisure; male; middle aged; prospective study; psychology; questionnaire; sex difference; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; Wounds and Injuries; young adult; Motor transportation","","","","","French Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Housing, Tourism and Sea, (SU0400066); National Agency for Research, (ANR-07-TSFA-007-01); Ministère des Affaires Sociales et de la Santé, (PHRC-N03, PHRC-N051); Ministère des Affaires Sociales et de la Santé","We acknowledge funding from the French Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Housing, Tourism and Sea (Predit 3 Program, “New Knowledge in the Field of Road Safety”: No SU0400066 ), from the National Agency for Research (Program Predit 4 “Safe, reliable and adapted transport” No. ANR-07-TSFA-007-01 ) and from the French Ministry of Health (PHRC 2003 Program: PHRC-N03 and PHRC 2005: PHRC-N051 ).

This article aims at appraising such a public policy by measuring its welfare impact, expressed as the Net Present Value (NPV) of the overall changes generated over 2007-2010. Faster bikes perform more kilometres in Paris. Some people shift from cars, buses, and subway to bikes and Vélibs. Switching from a passive mode of transportation to bicycle has a positive health impact. The amounts of C02, local pollutants, noise and congestion externalities generated by each mode are also changing. By contrast, the speed of car is slightly reduced, partially because of a narrowed road capacity. Public finance is affected by the change in fiscal revenues collected whereas the bike rental system's operator (Decaux) realizes some profits. Finally, the pro-bicycle policy has an initial investment cost and a residual value. All these changes are calculated and computed in a same monetary unit. This policy is (slightly) beneficial for society (a total NPV of +136 M€) even if the cost for public finance (-704 M€) is close to the bikers' benefit (+859 M€). Velibers are highly subsidized by the city. This policy is also working at the expense of the cars' drivers (- 286 M€) while positive externalities are not very important (+101 M€) and Decaux's profits are moderated (+166 M€).

Following the success of public bikesharing programs in cities in France and Canada, multiple US cities have initiated similar programs. With this background, spatial analysis has been applied to produce heat maps of bike-travel demand, and identify suitable areas for bikeshare infrastructure. Existing research considers a variety of factors, such as resident demographics, land use, street types, and availability of bike facilities and transit services. However, few studies fully account for topography and street connectivity. The study proposes a method to combine topography and presence of intersections with estimates of energy used to bike, and incorporate the resulting travel-impedance factor, as well as street connectivity, into a spatial analysis. Using the case in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA, where elevation and street connectivity differ substantially among neighborhoods, this study shows how the size and shape of bikesheds (or bike demand catchment area) originating from the proposed light rail stations vary in the analysis with or without taking into account these critical factors. The analysis results have significant implications for various bike planning efforts using spatial analysis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bike planning; Energy consumption to travel; Geographic information systems;

A method has been proposed to transform these graphs into a collection of signals indexed by vertices. This approach is here further explored in a number of different directions. First, the importance of a good indexing of a graph is stressed, and a solution is proposed using a node labeling algorithm which follows the structure of the graph. Second, a spectral analysis of identified signals is performed to compute features linked to graph properties such as regularity or structure in communities. Finally, these features can be tracked over time to evidence the structure evolution of the graph. As a case study, the approach is applied to a dynamic graph based on a dataset of trips made using the bike sharing system Vlov in use in Lyon, France. This is shown to offer specific insights on behaviors of bike users over time in two districts of the city. © 2013 IEEE.","Bike sharing system; Classical multidimensional scaling; Cyclic bandwidth; Dynamic networks; Transportation networks","Bicycles; Data processing; Spectrum analysis; Dynamic network; Graph properties; Labeling algorithms; Multi-dimensional scaling; Sharing systems; Structure evolution; Time evolutions; Transportation network; Graph theory","","","","","","","Shimada Y., Ikeguchi T., Shigehara T., From networks to time series, Phys.

Method: A sample of 155 young male participants (mean age = 17 ± 1.5) completed self-report questionnaires. Delinquent behaviour was assessed with the Antisocial behavior scales (ABS, Schawb-Stone et al., 1999) which include three subscales assessing behavior problems of different severity: conduct problems, assessing relatively mild behavior problems; less severe delinquency, assessing non-violent antisocial behavior; severe antisocial behavior, exploring relatively serious aggressive and antisocial behavior. The respondents were asked to report on a 5-point scale how many times (ranging from ""0 times"" to ""5 or more times"") they were involved in the described behaviors during the past year. In this study, only the two subscales assessing less severe delinquency and severe antisocial behavior were used. Personality psychopathic traits were assessed with the Youth psychopathic traits inventory (YPI; Andershed et al., 2002). It consists in three scales assessing interpersonal, affective (with callousness, which is considered as the core dimension of a psychopathy) and lifestyle traits of the psychopathic personality (α = 0.90, α = 0.81 and α = 0.77, respectively). Other questionnaires assessed borderline personality traits (Borderline personality features scale for children), depression (Center for epidemiological studies-depression scale), dissociation (Adolescent dissociative experience scale) (α = 0.83, 0.88 and 0.92 respectively) and cannabis use. Results: In the present study, the frequency of antisocial behaviour was important (55%): 7% of the adolescents had stolen a bike or a car at least once, 11% had committed a theft at least once, 36% had started a fight at least once, and 25% had threatened someone seriously or beaten up somebody at least once, 15% had had hurt someone badly in a physical fight so they had to be treated by a doctor or a nurse at least once, 21% had carried a blade, knife or gun at least once, 9% had been involved in a gang fight at least once, and 12% had carried a blade, knife or gun in school. A multiple regression analysis predicting antisocial behaviour in the total sample with the psychopathic and borderline traits, depressive and dissociative symptoms, alcohol and cannabis use, showed that delinquent behaviours were only predicted by alcohol and cannabis use and the psychopathic trait ""callousness"". Discussion: This study suggests the importance of callousness in explaining adolescent delinquent behaviour.

This study describes the influence of the type of residential municipality (with or without deprived urban areas, ""ZUS, zones urbaines sensibles""), used as an indicator of contextual deprivation, on the incidence and severity of road trauma involving people of under 25 years of age in the Rhône. Method: Injury data were taken from The Rhône Road Trauma Registry. The study covers the 2004-2007 period, with 13,589 young casualties. The incidence of traffic injury of all severities were computed according to the type of municipality and the age, gender, and type of road user. The ratios of the incidences of deprived municipalities, compared with others were calculated. Subsequently the severity factors and incidences according to the severity level (ISS 1-8, ISS 9+) were studied. Results: For the main types of road users except motorized two-wheeler users, the incidences were higher in the deprived municipalities: the greatest difference was for pedestrians, where the incidences were almost twice those of other municipalities. This excess risk, constituting a health inequality topic rarely considered, was even greater in municipalities with two or three ZUSs. It was essentially observed for minor injuries among motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians. Conclusions: While the incidence increased among people less than 25 years of age, the severity of road injuries was lower in deprived neighborhoods, contrary to what is suggested by other studies. This lower severity disappeared when taking into account the crash characteristics. Impact on industry: The incidence of injuries as a pedestrian, cyclist or motorist is higher among young people living in deprived municipalities. These areas should therefore be the targets of dedicated education programs, as well as further investigations about urban planning. © 2011 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

Ergometers with the capacity to measure torque throughout the knee extension cycle of each leg's pedalling motion (i.e. ComputrainerTM ergometer with Spinscan function) have the potential to provide the clinician with additional insight into the causes of anterior knee pain in selected patients. A 32-year-old male professional cyclist and former winner of the Tour de France with a 7-year history of recurrent anterior knee pain presented to the authors' Sports Medicine Clinic with an acute exacerbation of anterior right knee pain following early season volume-based training. MRI findings were of a low grade patellar tendinopathy. Isokinetic testing revealed increased eccentric knee flexion strength of the right (injured) vs. left leg (213.4Nm vs. 166.3Nm). The rate of fatigue for right knee concentric endurance extension was greater than the left leg (22.8% vs. 10.1%). A Computrainer Spinscan analysis was performed at cadences of 65-, 75-, 85-, 95- and 105rpm respectively. Mean power balance (51.0 ± 0.9%) was in favour of the right leg. This abnormality in power balance was most prevalent at cadences lower than 75rpm (51.9 ± 1.5%). Mechanical efficiency scores for cadences below 85rpm (57.8 ± 3.8%) were significantly lower than recorded for other elite male road cyclists in these authors' laboratory (70-85%). Right leg mean torque angles were lower for all cadences (84.3 ± 3.0) in comparison to the left leg. This was accentuated for cadences of 85rpm or lower (82.3 ± 2.4). These findings were consistent with a low grade infra-patellar tendinosis attributable to force overload induced by high volume, low cadence activity.","Anterior knee pain; Cycling","","","","","","","","Bohlman J.T., Injuries in competitive cycling, Physician Sports Med, 9, pp. 117-124, (1981); Conti-Wyneken A.R., Bicycling injuries, Phys Med.Rehabil.Clin.N.Am, 10, pp. 67-76, (1999); Sirin A.V., Wells R.P., Patla A.E., Bilateral power analysis of ergometer cycling, Proceedings of the American Society of Biomechanics, pp. 170-171, (2008); Smak W., Neptune R.R., Hull M.L., The influence of pedaling rate on bilateral asymmetry in cycling, J Biomech, 32, pp. 899-906, (1999); Holmes J.C., Pruitt A.L., Whalen N.J., Lower extremity overuse in bicycling, Clin.Sports Med, 13, pp. 187-205, (1994); Reilly D.T., Martens M., Experimental analysis of the quadriceps muscle force and patello-femoral joint reaction force for various activities, Acta Orthop.Scand, 43, pp. 126-137, (1972); Hunt M.A., Sanderson D.J., Moffet H., Et al., Interlimb asymmetry in persons with and without an anterior cruciate ligament deficiency during stationary cycling, Arch Phys Med.Rehabil, 85, pp. 1475-1478, (2004); Gregor R.J., Cavanagh P.R., LaFortune M., Knee flexor moments during propulsion in cycling-a creative solution to Lombard's Paradox, J Biomech, 18, pp. 307-316, (1985); Sanderson D.J., The influence of cadence and power output on the biomechanics of force application during steady-rate cycling in competitive and recreational cyclists, J Sports Sci, 9, pp. 191-203, (1991); Bertucci W., Grappe F., Girard A., Et al., Effects on the crank torque profile when changing pedalling cadence in level ground and uphill road cycling, J Biomech, 38, pp. 1003-1010, (2005); Thomee R., Augustsson J., Karlsson J., Patellofemoral pain syndrome: A review of current issues, Sports Med, 28, pp. 245-262, (1999); Marsh A.P., Martin P.E., The relationship between cadence and lower extremity EMG in cyclists and noncyclists, Med.Sci.Sports Exerc, 27, pp. 217-225, (1995); Gregor R.J., Cavanagh P.R., LaFortune M., Knee flexor moments during propulsion in cycling-a creative solution to Lombard's Paradox, J Biomech, 18, pp. 307-316, (1985); Boning D., Gonen Y., Maassen N., Relationship between work load, pedal frequency, and physical fitness, Int J Sports Med, 5, pp. 92-97, (1984); Chavarren J., Calbet J.A., Cycling efficiency and pedalling frequency in road cyclists, Eur.J Appl Physiol Occup.Physiol, 80, pp. 555-563, (1999); Lucia A., San Juan A.F., Montilla M., Et al., In professional road cyclists, low pedaling cadences are less efficient, Med.Sci.Sports Exerc, 36, pp. 1048-1054, (2004); Swain D.P., Wilcox J.P., Effect of cadence on the economy of uphill cycling, Med.Sci.Sports Exerc, 24, pp. 1123-1127, (1992); Ahlquist L.E., Bassett Jr. D.R., Sufit R., Et al., The effect of pedaling frequency on glycogen depletion rates in type I and type II quadriceps muscle fibers during submaximal cycling exercise, Eur.J Appl Physiol Occup.Physiol, 65, pp. 360-364, (1992)","J.

This is the superior conformity of the self (SCS). Our main hypothesis was that, among cyclists, women would show a higher SCS on cautiousness, though men would show a higher SCS concerning competence. 1799 cyclists provided a self-assessment of their own cautiousness and of other people's cautiousness. The same procedure was used for competence. Consistent with the hypothesis, the SCS was gender-specific: it was more prominent for women concerning cautiousness and more prominent for men concerning competence. These results could explain why people tend to ignore the safety campaigns.

Previous studies and mathematical models describing road cycling have not analysed performances per se. We describe the evolution of road cycling performance over the past 116 years. We studied the top ten cyclists' mean speeds in eight famous classic races and three European Grand Tours, using a previously published multi-exponential model that highlights the different progression periods of an event during the century. In addition, we measured an indicator of difficulty for the Tour de France by calculating the climbing index (i.e. the total altitude climbed over total distance). The eleven races' mean speed increased progressively from 23.13 km · h-1 in 1892 to 41.19 ± 2.03 km · h-1 in 2008. Road cycling development, like other quantifiable disciplines, fits a piecewise progression pattern that follows three periods: before, between, and after the two World Wars. However, a fourth period begins after 1993, providing a speed progression of 6.38% from the third one. The Tour de France's climbing index also provided insight into a recent paradoxical relationship with speeds: when the climbing index increased, the winner's speed also increased. Our results show a major improvement (6.38%) in road cycling performance in the last 20 years and question the role of extra-physiological parameters in this recent progression. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Erythropoietin; Physiological limits; Road cycling; Speed records; Technology","Altitude; Bicycling; France; Humans; Physical Endurance; altitude; article; bicycle; endurance; France; human; physiology","","","","","Centre National de Développement du Sport; Ministry of Health, Youth, and Sport","We thank the Centre National de Développement du Sport and the Ministry of Health, Youth, and Sport for financial assistance.

SRM power output profiles (SRM Trainingsystem, Jülich, Germany) were collected during 148 mass start stages during the 2005 Tour de France and analyzed to establish average power, heart rate (HR) and cadence produced in different terrain categories (flat [FLT]; semi-mountainous [SMT]; mountainous [MT]). The maximal mean power (MMP) for progressively longer durations was quantified. Average HR was similar between FLT (133 ± 10 bpm) and SMT (134 ± 8 bpm) but higher during MT (140 ± 3 bpm). Average power output revealed a similar trend (FLT 218 ± 21 W [3.1 ± 0.3 W/kg], SMT 228 ± 22 W [3.3 ± 0.3 W/kg], and MT 234 ± 13 W [3.3 ± 0.2 W/kg]). Cadence during MT was approximately 6-7 rpm lower (81 ± 15 rpm) compared to FLT or SMT. During MT stages, the MMP for 1800 sec. was highest (394 W vs. 342 W) but the MMP 15 was lower (836 W vs. 895 W) compared to FLT.

The measurement campaign took place during the winter period of 2007 and 2008. Measured pollutants are carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes and PM2,5. The results are compared with the values obtained during a study led between 1996-1998 in similar conditions, but also with data collected at the same moment of the day by the Parisian air quality survey network. Generally speaking, for measured pollutants, pedestrians, tramway passengers and cyclists are the least exposed. The exposure in cars is the most important for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PM2,5 absorption coefficient and formaldehyde. PM2,5 mass concentration is higher in the underground lines of the Parisian subway system, where a spécifié particles source is observed. The comparison with results provided by Parisian air quality survey network indicates that measurement stations, even though situated on sidewalks in border of road, are not fully représentative of the real exposure of people travelling through Paris, especially the car passengers on Paris ring road. A significant decrease of benzene and carbon monoxide levels is observed between the studies of 1998 and 2008 (about 80%).","Air; Carbon monoxide; City-dweller; Exposure; Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Nitrogen dioxide; PM; Pollution; Transport","France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; Parisia; absorption coefficient; air quality; aldehyde; aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; automobile; bus transport; carbon monoxide; commuting; cycle transport; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pedestrian; pollution exposure; traffic congestion; urban area; urban pollution; urban transport; walking; workplace","","","","","","","Coursimault A., Delaunay C., Goupil G., Et al., Évaluation de l'exposition des citadins aux polluants d'origine automobile au cours de leurs déplacements dans l'agglomération parisienne, 2, pp. 325-330, (2000); WHO Air quality Guidelines for Europe, 91, (2000)","","","","","","","","","00323632","","POATB","","French","Pollut.

Eighteen cyclists participated in this study. Each subject completed three sessions. The initial session was to evaluate the maximal isokinetic voluntary contraction level of lower limb. The second session was an incremental test to exhaustion. During the third session subjects performed a constant cycling exercise (20 min) conducted at five randomly cadences (50, 70, 90, 110 rpm) and at the preferred cadence (FCC) at the power reached at ventilatory threshold. Cardiorespiratory and EMG values were recorded. A metabolic optimum (EOC) was observed at 63.5 ± 7.8 rpm different from preferred cadence (FCC, 90.6 ± 9.1 rpm). No difference was found between FCC and the neuromuscular optimal cadence (NOC, 93.5 ± 4). Significant relationships were found between EOC, NOC and strength capacities (r = - 0.75 and - 0. 63), whereas FCC was only related with V̇O2max (r = 0.59). The main finding of this study was that during submaximal cycling energetically optimal cadence or neuromuscular optimum in trained cyclists was significantly related with strength capacity and whereas preferred cadence seems to be related with endurance training status of cyclists. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Cyclists;

Among intuitive results, it is found that wearing a helmet lowers the average probability of such a crash; it is also shown that young bicyclists are, on average, more exposed to severe and/or fatal crashes.

The development of tools to accurately measuretime and distance in the nineteenth century inspired some humans todefine the limits of this special capacity. Beginning with Six-Day ProfessionalPedestrian Races in London and New York in the 1880s, followed adecade later by Six-Day Professional Cycling Races - the immediate precursorof the first six-day Tour de France Cycliste race in 1903, which itself inspiredthe 1928 and 1929 4,960 km ""Bunion Derbies"" between Los Angelesand New York across the breadth of the United States of America - establishedthose unique sporting events that continue to challenge the modernlimits of human endurance. But an analysis of the total energy expenditure achieved by athletes competingin those events establishes that none approaches those reached by anothergroup - the explorers of the heroic age of polar exploration in the earlytwentieth century. Thus the greatest recorded human endurance performancesoccurred during the Antarctic sledding expeditions led by RobertScott in 1911/12 and Ernest Shackleton in 1914/16. By man-hauling sleds for10 hours daily for approximately 159 and 160 consecutive days respectively, members of those expeditions would have expended close to a total of1,000,000 kcal. By comparison completing a Six-Day Pedestrian event (55,000 kcal) or the Tour de France (168,000 kcal), or cycling (180,000 kcal)or running (340,000 kcal) across America, requires a considerably smallertotal energy expenditure. Thus the limits of human endurance were set at the start of the twentiethcentury and have not recently been approached. Given good health and anadequate food supply to prevent starvation and scurvy, these limits are set bythe mind, not by the body. For it is the mind that determines who chooses tostart and who best stays the distance. © Steinkopff Verlag 2006.","Cycling; Energy expenditure; Mind; Polar exploration; Psychology; Running; Words humans","Bicycling; Cold Climate; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Humans; Mountaineering; Physical Endurance; Running; Walking; carbon dioxide; oxygen; arterial carbon dioxide tension; arterial oxygen tension; athlete; body weight; caloric intake; cycling; editorial; endurance; energy expenditure; exercise; human; leg length; mountaineering; physical activity; physical performance; running; scurvy; sport; starvation; sweating; walking","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7","","","","","Berry H., (1990); Bramble D.M., Lieberman D.E., Endurancerunning and the evolution of Homo, Nature, 432, pp. 345-352, (2004); Cherry-Garrard A., The Worst Journey in the World, (1989); Foster C., Foster D., Speaking Withearth and Sky, (2005); Gonzalez-Alonso J., Teller C., Andersen S.L., Et al., Influence of body temperatureon the development of fatigueduring prolonged exercise in the heat, J Appl Physiol, 86, pp. 1032-1039, (1999); Gordon B., Baker J.C., Observationson the apparent adaptability ofthe body to infections, unusual hardships,changing environment and prolongedstrenuous exertion, Am J Med Sci, 178, pp. 1-8, (1929); Heacox K., Shackleton: The Antarctic Challenge, (1999); Heinrich B., Racing the Antelope, (2001); Hill A.V., The physiological basis of athletic records, Lancet, 2, pp. 481-486, (1925); Huntford R., The Last Place on Earth, (1981); Jeukendrup A.E., High Performance Cycling, Human Kinetics Publishers, (2002); Kenney W.L., DeGroot D.W., Holowatz L.A., Extremes of human heat tolerance: Life at the precipice of thermoregulatory failure, Journal of Thermal Biology, 29, pp. 479-485, (2004); Knechtle B., Enggist A., Jehle T., Energy turnover at the Race Across AMerica (RAAM) - A case report, Int.

Interest in blood doping soared after the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. Studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that transfusing red cells could speed endurance performance. Diverse athletes of the time were accused of blood doping. In the late 1980s, recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) began to supplant transfusion for doping. EPO use is a suspect in nearly 20 deaths in 4 years in European cyclists. In the 1998 Tour de France, a team was ejected for using EPO and six other teams quit the race. The beat goes on; in recent years, diverse endurance and sprint athletes have been caught or accused of using EPO. Tests to detect EPO are improving but are not yet foolproof. As EPO tests improve, blood transfusion is back in vogue and some athletes may have infused artificial blood. Tests for detecting artificial blood also exist, but it seems it will take widespread, year-round, unannounced, out-of-competition testing and stern penalties to deter blood doping. © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

It’s either right to enhance humans or wrong to do so. Enhancement’s proponents defend it for a propensity to promote human well-being or because a ban would restrict liberty. Its most radical advocates hope for improvements of our physical and psychological capacities of such magnitude and variety that we will no longer be human. They think that we will come to view the traits that make us human as handicapping our development as a species. For the members of this group, human enhancement is good. Enhancement’s opponents – sometimes labeled bioconservatives – seek to counter its appeal by pointing to values wedded to our humanity that are infringed by enhancement. According to them, societies that encourage or permit human enhancement will manifest dangerous inequalities. For these bioconservatives, human enhancement is bad. This chapter surveys and selectively samples from contemporary moral debates about human enhancement. It seeks to reveal some of the philosophical complexity obscured by the traditional dialectic. Proposed human enhancements are hugely varied in the means by which they may be achieved, in the human capacities that are their targets, and in the degree to which they enhance. Four philosophically disparate cases of human enhancement are the disgraced Tour de France cyclist Lance Armstrong’s use of synthetic erythropoietin (EPO) to enhance his sporting performances, the Hungarian educational psychologist László Polgár’s program of extended deliberate practice that turned his three daughters into chess masters, the manipulation of genes that influence human intelligence, and a recent suggestion that we use selected pharmaceuticals to enhance our moral motivations and thereby avoid extinction by climate change. © Steven Luper, 2014.","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","978-113914912-9; 978-110702287-4","","","English","The Camb.

Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Paris 75005, France","The frequent use of glucocorticoids by athletes necessitates testing for adrenal insufficiency because of the risk of death in cases of associated severe stress (trauma, infection). During the 2001 and 2002 sporting seasons, we assessed the value of measuring baseline serum cortisol concentrations and the frequency of corticosteroid use during compulsory medical tests carried out by the French Cycling Federation on 659 elite cyclists (585 men and 74 women); the risk of adrenal insufficiency is negatively correlated with the basal serum cortisol level. Adrenal insufficiency was suspected in 34 cyclists (5.2%; 22 in 2001 and 12 in 2002) on the basis of below normal cortisol concentrations and in three cyclists (in 2001) because they had received corticosteroid treatment. In 2001, 10 of the 25 cyclists convoked underwent baseline follow-up serum cortisol determinations and 15 underwent dynamic exploration of adrenal function with the short ACTH test. Adrenal function was found to be deficient in four of these cyclists, at the limits of the normal range in four and normal in seven. Based on these results, the FFC sent a questionnaire in 2002 to all the cyclists to assess the use of corticosteroid in this population. This survey revealed that 85 of 538 cyclists (15.8%) had received corticosteroid treatment in the previous 3 months. Moreover, 11 of the 12 cyclists (92%) with low basal serum cortisol concentrations had received corticosteroid therapy. These results show that basal serum cortisol is relevant to detect adrenal insufficiency in sportsmen, in particular in cases of values below the normal range. The high frequency of corticosteroid use among elite cyclists, and in particular road cyclists who are at risk of trauma and infection, justifies screening tests to detect adrenal insufficiency. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Adrenal insufficiency; Corticosteroid; Doping; Sportsmen","Adrenal Cortex Function Tests; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adrenal Insufficiency; Adult; Bicycling; Doping in Sports; Female; Follow-Up Studies; France; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Seasons; Sports Medicine; Substance Abuse Detection; Time Factors; beclometasone; betamethasone; budesonide; corticosteroid; corticotropin; cortivazol; fluticasone; hydrocortisone; methylprednisolone; mometasone furoate; prednisolone; prednisone; triamcinolone; adrenal function; adrenal insufficiency; adult; article; chemoluminescence; controlled study; correlation analysis; corticotropin test; cycling; doping; drug use; endocrine function test; female; fluorometry; follow up; health survey; hormone determination; human; hydrocortisone blood level; major clinical study; male; priority journal; questionnaire; risk assessment; screening test; self report","","beclometasone, 4419-39-0; betamethasone, 378-44-9; budesonide, 51333-22-3; corticotropin, 11136-52-0, 9002-60-2, 9061-27-2; cortivazol, 1110-40-3; fluticasone, 90566-53-3; hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; mometasone furoate, 83919-23-7; prednisolone, 50-24-8; prednisone, 53-03-2; triamcinolone, 124-94-7; Adrenal Cortex Hormones, ; Hydrocortisone, 50-23-7","","","French Ministry of Sports; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Inserm","Acknowledgments This study was funded by the French Ministry of Sports, by French professional cycling groups, by INSERM Unit 515 and the University Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI.

Using the rate of lost life years, the present study provides a public health approach to quantify this potential threat. Methods: A total of 1 570 686 motorised vehicle drivers or motorcycle riders and 652 246 non-drivers, i.e. vehicle passengers, pedestrians and cyclists involved in injury crashes in France between 1996 and 2004, were included in a population based cross-sectional study. Fatality rates and rate of lost life years for each crash-involved driver age class were calculated for the drivers themselves and for other road users. Results: The study has shown a significant reduction in the rate of lost life years for crash-involved other road users (whether passengers, pedestrians, cyclists or opposing drivers) as driver age increases. Other road users lost half as many years of life when involved in crashes with drivers aged over 85 than with drivers under 65 (1.26 and 2.32 per 100 expected remaining life years, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that among road users involved in injury crashes, older drivers are less dangerous for the other road users. By attributing other road users' lost life years to each driver age, this study represents a new contribution to the debate about ageing and road safety. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Eight well-trained male cyclists completed 20 prolonged cycling stages interspersed by two rest days (days 9 and 17), which replicated the 2007 Tour de France route and schedule. Isometric knee extensor torque and EMG responses of the vastus lateralis in response to percutaneous electrical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured before, on days 9 and 17, and 2 d after completion of Tour de France. Postexercise measurements on days 9 and 17 were taken >18 h after cessation of the previous exercise bout. RESULTS: Maximal voluntary contraction of the knee extensors decreased by 20 ± 10% (P < 0.01) during Tour de France but recovered after 2 d of rest. Peripherally evoked M-wave and potentiated twitch responses were also significantly decreased during Tour de France, up to 31 ± 21% and 22 ± 18%, respectively (P < 0.05), but returned to baseline values after 2 d of recovery. Voluntary activation was reduced to 75 ± 8% (P < 0.05) during Tour de France and remained significantly depressed (79 ± 7%, P < 0.05) after completion. The amplitude of motor evoked potentials was decreased by 44 ± 28% (P < 0.01) on day 9 and remained significantly depressed during the remainder of, and after, Tour de France. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in knee extensor strength, which occurs after repetitive prolonged cycling exercise, is a result of both central and peripheral processes. Reduced sarcolemmal excitability and impairment of contractile mechanisms exists even after 18 h of recovery. An enduring reduction in corticomotor output persists even after 2 d of rest.

While helmet use is likely to provide protection, their use often remains rare. We assessed the influence of strategies for promotion of helmet use with direct observation of behaviour by a semi-automatic video system. Methods: We performed a single-centre randomised controlled study, with 4 balanced randomisation groups. Participants were non-helmet users, aged 18-75 years, recruited at a loan facility in the city of Bordeaux, France. After completing a questionnaire investigating their attitudes towards road safety and helmet use, participants were randomly assigned to three groups with the provision of ""helmet only"", ""helmet and information"" or ""information only"", and to a fourth control group. Bikes were labelled with a colour code designed to enable observation of helmet use by participants while cycling, using a 7-spot semi-automatic video system located in the city. A total of 1557 participants were included in the study. Results: Between October 15th 2009 and September 28th 2010, 2621 cyclists' movements, made by 587 participants, were captured by the video system. Participants seen at least once with a helmet amounted to 6.6% of all observed participants, with higher rates in the two groups that received a helmet at baseline. The likelihood of observed helmet use was significantly increased among participants of the ""helmet only"" group (OR = 7.73 [2.09-28.5]) and this impact faded within six months following the intervention. No effect of information delivery was found. Conclusion: Providing a helmet may be of value, but will not be sufficient to achieve high rates of helmet wearing among adult cyclists. Integrated and repeated prevention programmes will be needed, including free provision of helmets, but also information on the protective effect of helmets and strategies to increase peer and parental pressure. © 2012 Constant et al.","","Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bicycling; Craniocerebral Trauma; Female; France; Head Protective Devices; Health Behavior; Health Education; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Questionnaires; Videotape Recording; Young Adult; adult; aged; article; behavior; controlled study; cycling; female; France; health promotion; helmet; human; human experiment; male; normal human; observation; questionnaire; randomization; traffic safety; videorecording; adolescent; bicycle; France; head injury; health behavior; health education; injury; middle aged; prevalence; psychological aspect; traffic accident; utilization review","","","","","","","Constant A., Lagarde E., Protecting vulnerable road users from injury, PLoS Med, 7, (2010); Liu B.C., Ivers R., Norton R., Boufous S., Blows S., Et al., Helmets for preventing injury in motorcycle riders, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, (2008); Thompson D.C., Rivara F.P., Thompson R., Helmets for preventing head and facial injuries in bicyclists, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, (2000); Transport Safety Performance in the EU, A Statistical Overview, (2003); Elvik R., Publication bias and time-trend bias in meta-analysis of bicycle helmet efficacy: a re-analysis of Attewell, Glase and McFadden, 2001, Accid Anal Prev, 43, pp. 1245-1251, (2011); Attewell R.G., Glase K., McFadden M., Bicycle helmet efficacy: a meta-analysis, Accid Anal Prev, 33, pp. 345-352, (2001); Walker I., Drivers overtaking bicyclists: objective data on the effects of riding position, helmet use, vehicle type and apparent gender, Accid Anal Prev, 39, pp. 417-425, (2007); Adams J., Hillman M., The risk compensation theory and bicycle helmets, Inj Prev, 7, pp. 89-90, (2001); Robinson D.L., Bicycle helmet legislation: can we reach a consensus?, Accid Anal Prev, 39, pp. 86-93, (2007); Robinson D.L., Head injuries and bicycle helmet laws, Accid Anal Prev, 28, pp. 463-475, (1996); Carnall D., Cycle helmets should not be compulsory, BMJ, 318, (1999); Jacobsen P.L., Safety in numbers: more walkers and bicyclists, safer walking and bicycling, Inj Prev, 9, pp. 205-209, (2003); Royal S.T., Kendrick D., Coleman T., Non-legislative interventions for the promotion of cycle helmet wearing by children, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, (2005); Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: a theory of planned behaviour, Action Control: From Cognition to Behaviour, (1985); Ajzen I., Attitudes, Personality and Behaviour, (1988); Cummings K.M., Jette A.M., Rosenstock I.M., Construct validation of the health belief model, Health Educ Monogr, 6, pp. 394-405, (1978); Lajunen T., Rasanen M., Can social psychological models be used to promote bicycle helmet use among teenagers?

Based on the concept of scaling and the concept of human capital, the paper aims to derive a set of hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data were collected about all riders that finished the Tour in the years from 2002 to 2005 leading to a total number of n=600 observations. Random effects regression models are estimated with rank as the dependent variable. Findings: The findings indicate that lighter riders perform better in the Tour than heavier cyclists. Better teammates were found to increase average riders' performances, whereas top riders did not benefit from top teammates. Experience (rider, teammates, coach) was a significant driver of performance. Research limitations/implications: Team managers should pay attention to the composition of the team. Having only one strong team captain and several good coworkers was more effective than having several star riders (i.e. potential captains) in a team. Practical implications: The findings with regard to team composition can be transferred to other sports and professions where teamwork plays an important role. Successful teams should consist of only one captain and several good coworkers. Originality/value: The paper extends previous work on the determinants of performance in the Tour by using a longitudinal dataset that covers more variables than previous research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cycling;

METHODS: Eleven cyclists performed four 8-s nonisokinetic sprints on a cycle ergometer against four randomized friction loads (0.5, twice 0.75, and 0.9 N·kg of body mass). Power output and EMG activity of both right and left gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and vastus lateralis were measured continuously. Individual crank cycles were analyzed. Crank angles corresponding to the beginning and the peak of each downstroke and EMG burst onset and offset crank angles were computed. Moreover, crank angles corresponding to the beginning and the end of muscle force response were determined assuming a 100-ms lag time between the EMG activity and the relevant force response (or electromechanical delay). RESULTS: Muscle coordination (EMG onset and offset) was altered at high pedaling rates. Thus, crank angles corresponding to muscle force response increased significantly with pedaling rate. Consequently, at pedaling rates higher than the optimal pedaling rate, force production of lower-limb extensor muscles was shifted later in the crank cycle. Mechanical data confirmed that downstrokes occurred later in the crank cycle when pedaling rate increased. Hence, force was produced on the pedals during less effective crank cycle sectors of the downstroke and during the beginning of the upstroke. CONCLUSION: During nonisokinetic sprint cycling, the decrease in power output when pedaling rates increased beyond PRopt may be partly explained by suboptimal muscle coordination. ©2007The American College of Sports Medicine.","Activation dynamics; Electromyography; Muscle coordination; Optimal pedaling rate","Adult; Bicycling; Electromyography; Exertion; France; Humans; Male; Muscle Contraction; adult; article; body mass; coordination; cycling; electromyography; ergometer; extensor muscle; force; friction; gluteus maximus muscle; human; human experiment; isokinetic exercise; male; muscle force; quadriceps femoris muscle; rectus femoris muscle; vastus lateralis muscle","","","","","","","ARSAC L.M., BELLI A., LACOUR J.R., Muscle function during brief maximal exercise: Accurate measurements on a friction-loaded cycle ergometer, Eur.

The lubricant producers stress products of superior quality. For the other large outlet, that of industrial equipment, the keyword is customer support. The oil companies have 60-70% of the lubricants market. The Total company has 25% of the market followed by ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP. Other companies purchase the base oil from the oil companies, mix it with additives, and sell the resulting lubricants. There are dozens of them, including Fuchs, Igol, and Motul as leaders, followed by other groups such as Yacco, Accor, and Hafa, among others. The competition among these groups hardens in France in those areas where demand is the greatest. In 2005, the use of lubricants in France was 768,336 tonnes, a 2.5% drop from 2004. The leading market for lubricants is in engines for automobiles, motor bikes, trucks, boats, tractors, buses, and trains. In this market, pressure remains in reducing the frequency of oil changes. This is counterbalanced by the increase in the number of automobiles in use. The other large lubricant users are in industry where the products include industrial greases, metalworking fluids, turbine oils, gear oils, cutting oils, compressor oils, and process oils. In industrial uses the flagging out, environmental concerns, and the pursuit of waste explain the reduction in demand. The global demand for lubricants increases because of the increasing number of automobiles in the world especially in countries with strong growth such as India and China. The market in Asia-Pacific is growing strongly, that in America is stable, and in Europe is in slight decline. The large oil companies in France now organize themselves at the level of Europe rather than that of France. France plays a key role in this because it is one of the five countries that represent 70-80% of the European market (with Germany, the UK, and to a less extent Italy and Spain) and because it is a strong producer of lubricants. The lubricants exports from France are 1.4 million tonnes/yr. The largest European lubricants plant is that of ExxonMobil in France producing 500,000 tonnes/yr with half of this volume sold as base oils and the other half transformed to finished products by mixing in additives bought notably from Lubrizol or Infineum, a Shell and ExxonMobil joint venture. By 2008-2012 gas-to-liquid oils from Qatar and elsewhere are expected to arrive on the market as a source of lubricants. The recycling of used oils is expected to increase as well in the future with the regenerated lubricants possessing increased performance such as in Germany, Italy, and the USA.

Amateur cyclists, however, will often avoid uphill terrain because of the discomfort involved. Therefore, understanding movement behavior during uphill cycling is needed in order to find an optimum solution that can be applied in practice. The aim of this review is to assess the quality of research performed on biomechanics and the energetics of uphill cycling. Altogether we have analyzed over 40 articles from scientific and expert periodicals that provided results on . energetics, pedal and joint forces, economy and efficiency, muscular activity, as well as performance and comfort optimization during uphill cycling. During uphill cycling, cyclists need to overcome gravity and in order to achieve this, some changes in posture are necessary. The main results from this review are that changes in muscular activity are present, while on the other hand pedal forces, joint dynamics, and cycling efficiency are not substantially altered during seated uphill cycling compared to cycling on level terrain. In contrast, during standing uphill cycling, all of the previously mentioned measures are different when comparing either seated uphill cycling or level terrain cycling. Further research should focus on outdoor studies and steeper slopes.","Biomechanics; Efficiency; Optimization; Performance; Physiology","","","","","","","","Alvarez G., Vinyolas J., A new bicycle pedal design for on-road measurements of cycling forces, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, 12, 1, pp. 130-142, (1996); Atkinson G., Davison R., Jeukendrup A., Passfield L., Science and cycling: Current knowledge and future directions for research, Journal of Sports Sciences, 21, 9, pp. 767-787, (2003); Bertucci W., Grappe F., Girard A., Betik A., Rouillon J.D., Effects on the crank torque profile when changing pedalling cadence in level ground and uphill road cycling, Journal of Biomechanics, 38, 5, pp. 1003-1010, (2005); Bertucci W., Grappe F., Groslambert A., Laboratory versus outdoor cycling conditions: Differences in pedaling biomechanics, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, 23, 2, pp. 87-92, (2007); Bini R.R., Diefenthaeler F., Mechanical work and coordinative pattern of cycling: A literature review, Kinesiology, 41, 1, pp. 25-39, (2009); Bini R.R., Diefenthaeler F., Kinetics and kinematics analysis of incremental cycling to exhaustion, Sports Biomechanics, 9, 4, pp. 223-235, (2010); Bini R.R., Hume R.A., Cerviri A., A comparison of cycling SRM crank and strain gauge instrumented pedal measures of peak torque, crank angle at peak torque and power output, Procedia Engineering, 13, pp. 56-61, (2011); Bini R.R., Diefenthaeler F., Mota C.B., Fatigue effects on the coordinative pattern during cycling: Kinetics and kinematics evaluation, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 20, 1, pp. 102-107, (2010); Bini R.R., Tamborindeguy A.C., Mota C.B., Effects of saddle height, pedaling cadence, and workload on joint kinetics and kinematics during cycling, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 19, 3, pp. 301-314, (2010); Burke E.R., Proper fit of the bicycle, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 13, 1, pp. 1-14, (1994); Caldwell G.E., Hagberg J.M., McCole S.D., Li L., Lower extremity joint moments during uphill cycling, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, 15, 2, pp. 166-181, (1999); Caldwell G.E., Li L., McCole S.D., Hagberg J.M., Pedal and crank kinetics in uphill cycling, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, 14, 3, pp. 245-259, (1998); Cannon D.T., Kolkhorst F.W., Cipriani D.J., Effect of pedaling technique on muscle activity and cycling efficiency, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 99, 6, pp. 659-664, (2007); Clarys J.P., Alewaeters K., Zinzen E., The influence of geographic variations on the muscular activity in selected sports movements, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 11, 6, pp. 451-457, (2001); Coyle E.F., Feltner M.E., Kautz S.A., Hamilton M.T., Montain S.J., Baylor A.M., Abraham L.D., Et al., Physiological and biomechanical factors associated with elite endurance cycling performance, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 23, 1, pp. 93-107, (1991); Coyle E.F., Sidossis L.S., Horowitz J.F., Beltz J.D., Cycling efficiency is related to the percentage of type I muscle fibers, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 24, 7, pp. 782-788, (1992); De Groot G., Sargeant A., Geysel J., Air friction and rolling resistance during cycling, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 27, 1, pp. 1090-1095, (1995); De Vey Mestdagh K., Personal perspective: In search of an optimum cycling posture, Applied Ergonomics, 29, 5, pp. 325-334, (1998); Di Prampero P.E., The energy cost of human locomotion on land and in water, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 7, 2, pp. 55-72, (1986); Di Prampero P.E., Cycling on Earth, in space, on the Moon, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 82, 5-6, pp. 345-360, (2000); Di P.P.E., Cortili G., Mognoni P., Saibene F., Equation of motion of a cyclist, Journal of Applied Physiology Respiratory Environmental and Exercise Physiology, 47, 1, pp. 201-206, (1979); Disley B.X., Li F.-X., The effect of Q Factor on gross mechanical efficiency and muscular activation in cycling, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, (2012); Dorel S., Couturier A., Hug F., Intra-session repeatability of lower limb muscles activation pattern during pedaling, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 18, 5, pp. 857-865, (2008); Dorel S., Couturier A., Hug F., Influence of different racing positions on mechanical and electromyographic patterns during pedalling, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 19, 1, pp. 44-54, (2009); Due S., Bertucci W., Pernin J.N., Grappe F., Muscular activity during uphill cycling: Effect of slope, posture, hand grip position and constrained bicycle lateral sways, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 18, 1, pp. 116-127, (2008); Ericson M., On the biomechanics of cycling.

These adaptations explain why the current men's marathon world record holder can run 42.195 km (26.2 miles) in a little over 2 hours at an average speed of over 20 km/h. The adaptations which enable sustained endurance performance also offer protection against many chronic diseases and increase average lifespan. For example, former cyclists who competed in the Tour de France before 1964 demonstrated a 17% increase in average longevity compared with the general population1. Therefore studying the elite endurance athlete can give us clues as to how partaking in regular physical activity, or failure to do so, alters disease risk and life expectancy. © Biochemical Society.","Athlete's Paradox; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Accumulation","","","","","","","","Sanchis-Gomar F., Olaso-Gonzalez D., Corella D., Gomez-Cabrera M.C., Vina J., Int.

Investigation centres on print media, online discussion forums, and participant interviews. Innovative borrowings are argued to derive from a fetishization of English along the lines of Kelly Holmes (1997, 2000), whereby connotation is equally or more important than reference. It is further suggested that participants employ these innovative forms to distinguish themselves and solidify group identity, constituting a sort of sociolinguistic niche. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.","","","","","","","","","Alba O., Integracíon fońetica y morfóogica de los prestamos: datos del léxico dominicano del b́eisbol, Revista de Ling̈ú?stica Téorica y Aplicada, 452, pp. 89-109, (2007); Altmann E., Pierrehumbert J., Motter A., Niche as a determinant of word fate in online groups, PLoS One, 6, 5, pp. 1-12, (2011); Artiomov R.N., Socio-linguistic research in sociology of sport, International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 13, pp. 95-107, (1978); Ayres-Bennett W., Carruthers J., Temple R., Problems and Perspectives: Studies in the Modern French Language, (2001); Barrett R., Markedness and style shifting in Performances by African American Drag Queens, Codes and Consequences: Choosing Linguistic Variables, pp. 139-161, (1998); Beckner C., Blythe R., Bybee J., Christianen M., Croft W., Ellis N., Holland J., Ke J., Larsen-Freeman D., Schoenemann T., Language as a complex adaptive system: Position paper, Language Learning, 59, pp. 1-26, (2009); Bernard M., Les anglicismes dans le sport et le ph'enom̀ene de l'emprunt śemantique, Cahiers de l'Institut de Linguistique de Louvain, 32, pp. 181-194, (2006); Chesley P., Lexical borrowings in French: Anglicisms as a separate phenomenon, Journal of French Language Studies, 20, pp. 231-251, (2010); Crystal D., Language and the Internet, (2006); Deppermann A., Anglizismen in Skatermagazinen: Zur Behandlung jugendkultureller Medien im Deutschunterricht, Der Deutschunterricht, 506, pp. 70-73, (1998); Dovey H., Parlez-vous franglais or Do you speak Frenglish?, Francophonie, 11, pp. 43-45, (1995); Forgue G.J., English loan words in French today, Journal of English Linguistics, 19, pp. 285-294, (1986); Guedon J.-C., Internet and global communication technologies: Toward a new linguistic ecology, TEXT Technology, 73, pp. 65-87, (1997); Haugen E., The analysis of linguistic borrowing, Language, 26, pp. 210-231, (1950); Haugen E., The Ecology of Language, (1972); Herring S., Computer-mediated discourse, The Handbook of Discourse Analysis, pp. 612-634, (2001); Kelly-Holmes H., Language maintenance or language fetishisation?

Very little is known about the physiological and performance decline of professional cyclists after retirement from competition. To gain some insight into the aging and detraining process of elite cyclists, 5-time Tour de France winner and Olympic Champion Miguel Indurain performed a progressive cycle-ergometer test to exhaustion 14 y after retirement from professional cycling (age 46 y, body mass 92.2 kg). His maximal values were oxygen uptake 5.29 L/min (57.4 mL · kg-1 · min-1), aerobic power output 450 W (4.88 W/kg), heart rate 191 beats/min, blood lactate 11.2 mM. Values at the individual lactate threshold (ILT): 4.28 L/min (46.4 mL · kg-1 · min-1), 329 W (3.57 W/kg), 159 beats/min, 2.4 mM. Values at the 4-mM onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA): 4.68 L/min (50.8 mL · kg-1 · min-1), 369 W (4.00 W/kg), 170 beats/min. Average cycling gross efficiency between 100 and 350 W was 20.1%, with a peak value of 22.3% at 350 W. Delta efficiency was 27.04%. Absolute maximal oxygen uptake and aerobic power output declined by 12.4% and 15.2% per decade, whereas power output at ILT and OBLA declined by 19.8% and 19.2%. Larger declines in maximal and submaximal values relative to body mass (19.4-26.1%) indicate that body composition changed more than aerobic characteristics. Nevertheless, Indurain's absolute maximal and submaximal oxygen uptake and power output still compare favorably with those exhibited by active professional cyclists. © 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Detraining; Efficiency; Performance; Reduced training","","","","","","","","Coyle E.F., Improved muscular efficiency displayed as Tour de France champion matures, Journal of Applied Physiology, 98, 6, pp. 2191-2196, (2005); Padilla S., Mujika I., Angulo F., Goiriena J.J., Scientific approach to the 1-h cycling world record: A case study, J Appl Physiol., 89, pp. 1522-1527, (2000); Wiswell R.A., Hawkins S.A., Jaque V., Hyslop D., Constantino N., Tarpenning K., Marcell T., Schroeder T.E., Relationship between physiological loss, performance decrement, and age in master athletes, Journals of Gerontology - Series A Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences, 56, 10, (2001); Faulkner J.A., Davis C.S., Mendias C.L., Brooks S.V., The aging of elite male athletes: Age-related changes in performance and skeletal muscle structure and function, Clin J Sport Med., 18, pp. 501-507, (2008); Hagberg J.M., Coyle E.F., Physiological determinants of endurance performance as studied in competitive racewalkers, Med Sci Sports Exerc., 15, pp. 287-289, (1983); Sjodin B., Jacobs I., Onset of blood lactate accumulation and marathon running performance, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 1, pp. 23-26, (1981); Hopker J., Coleman D., Passfield L., Changes in cycling efficiency during a competitive season, Med Sci Sports Exerc., 41, pp. 912-919, (2009); Peronnet F., Massicotte D., Table of nonprotein respiratory quotient: An update, Can J Sport Sci., 16, pp. 23-29, (1991); Santalla A., Naranjo J., Terrados N., Muscle efficiency improves over time in world-class cyclists, Med Sci Sports Exerc., 41, pp. 1096-1101, (2009); Trappe S.W., Costill D.L., Vukovich M.D., Jones J., Melham T., Aging among elite distance runners: A 22-yr longitudinal study, Journal of Applied Physiology, 80, 1, pp. 285-290, (1996); Padilla S., Mujika I., Cuesta G., Goiriena J.J., Level ground and uphill cycling ability in professional road cycling, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 31, 6, pp. 878-885, (1999)","","","Human Kinetics Publishers Inc.","","","","","","15550265","","","22868823","English","Int.

Bicycle crashes need to be studied, preferably by type of cycling. Here we conduct a descriptive analysis. Method. A road trauma registry has been in use in France since 1996, in a large county around Lyon (the Rhône, population 1.6 million). It covers outpatients, inpatients and fatalities. All injuries are coded using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Proxies were used to identify three types of cycling: learning = children (0-10 years old); sports cycling = teenagers and adults injured outside towns; cycling as means of transport = teenagers and adults injured in towns. The study is based on 13,684 cyclist casualties (1996-2008). Results: The percentage of cyclists injured in a collision with a motor vehicle was 8% among children, 17% among teenagers and adults injured outside towns, and 31% among those injured in towns. The percentage of serious casualties (MAIS 3+) was 4.5% among children, 10.9% among adults injured outside towns and 7.2% among those injured in towns. Collisions with motor-vehicles lead to more internal injuries than bicycle-only crashes. Conclusion: The description indicates that cyclist type is associated with different crash and injury patterns. In particular, cyclists injured in towns (where cycling is increasing) are generally less severely injured than those injured outside towns for both types of crash (bicycle-only crashes and collisions with a motor vehicle). This is probably due to lower speeds in towns, for both cyclists and motor vehicles. © 2011 Amoros et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Abbreviated Injury Scale; Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Athletic Injuries; Bicycling; Child; Child, Preschool; Environment Design; Female; France; Humans; Infant; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Transportation; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; article; bicycle; child; classification; environmental planning; female; France; human; infant; injury; injury scale; learning; male; methodology; middle aged; mortality; preschool child; register; risk factor; sex ratio; sport injury; statistics; traffic accident; traffic and transport","","","","","Institut de Veille Sanitaire, InVS, (J06-24); Institut de Veille Sanitaire, InVS","We would like to thank all the persons who took part in data collection and data recording, both within the Rhône Road Trauma Registry Association (ARVAC, president E Javouhey), and within the IFSTTAR-UMRESTTE research unit (B Laumon, scientific adviser and A Ndiaye, medical coordinator).

Born in London, Cole studied at the Royal School of Mines and lectured for a number of years at Bedford College for Ladies. Largely concurrent with his professorship he served as Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland at a time when it was in moderate decline. He undertook many cycling tours around continental Europe and Ireland. These trips were recounted in two early travel books. The Gypsy Road: a Journey from Krakow to Coblentz, published in 1894, provides a delightful account of a tour undertaken by him on a tricycle and his companion on a penny farthing, across what is now Poland, the Czech Republic, and eastern Germany. In a later slim volume entitled As We Ride, co-authored with his wife, a number of expeditions to France and the Balkans are eloquently described. Between 1902 and 1908 he organized a week-long geological excursion to various parts of Ireland for his students, and transport was by train and bicycle. His cycling trips provided him with the opportunity to collect research materials, make geological observations, and to photograph features of interest. Subsequently much of this material was used in his publications and in teaching. Cole's main academic studies were in igneous and metamorphic petrology. He valued and promoted fieldwork as an essential component of geological training.

R., Dallas, TX, United States; Lucia A., Exercise Physiology Laboratory, European University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Background: Athletic competitions, such as the Tour de France, demand both momentary bursts of very high power output and the ability to provide high levels of energy expenditure for several weeks. As such, they provide a model of the ability for sustained muscular activity, which is important in terms of how humans are understood, not only as athletes, but also within an evolutionary context. Methods: Laboratory correlated HR responses were made of elite professional cyclists (N = 7) during successive competitions in one of the three grand tours in cycling in successive years, with the intent of evaluating the magnitude and pattern of energy expenditure. HR recordings were normalized into a training impulse (TRIMP) score, summating the intensity and duration of each race, and tracked over the duration of successive tours. Results: Although the day-by-day pattern of HR responses in exercise intensity zones associated with exercise intensities below the first ventilatory threshold, between the first and second ventilatory thresholds, and above the second ventilatory threshold varied in response to the course and competitive situation, the net accumulation of both time in each of the HR zones and TRIMP was remarkably constant from one tour to the next, both within the group at large as well as within individual athletes. The magnitude of accumulation of TRIMP was similar to that of previous reports on elite tour cyclists. Conclusions: We interpret these results as evidence that humans adopt a pacing strategy designed to optimally distribute energy reserves over the duration of each tour.

METHODS: Before and after three sets of 31 isokinetic concentric knee extensions at 60°·s, voluntary and electrically induced contractions were recorded in 14 endurance-trained (ENDU) men (seven cyclists: age 25 ± 2 yr, mass 70 ± 8 kg, height 175 ± 5 cm; and seven triathletes: age 27 ± 4 yr, mass 71 ± 5 kg, height 179 ± 6 cm) and seven explosive power-trained men (EXPLO: age 24 ± 1 yr, mass 73 ± 5 kg, height 179 ± 4 cm). Maximal knee-extension torque, activation level (twitch interpolation technique), electromyographic activity of agonist and antagonist muscles, and twitch contractile properties were assessed. RESULTS: At preexercise, the maximal voluntary isometric and concentric torques of EXPLO were greater than those of ENDU (P < 0.05). After the fatiguing exercise, significant isometric (18%; P < 0.01) and concentric (25%; P < 0.05) torque decreases in EXPLO were associated with, respectively, twitch torque (Pt) and maximal rate of twitch development (+dPt/dt) reductions (P < 0.01) and with an increase in the antagonist coactivation level (P < 0.01). No modification was observed for ENDU. Interestingly, the coactivation level was also increased (P < 0.01) in eccentric contraction for EXPLO, although the maximal eccentric torque decrease (P < 0.01) could not be specifically attributed to any group. CONCLUSION: The fatiguing exercise induced central and peripheral adaptations, but the mechanisms differed regarding the contraction mode. At pre- and postfatiguing exercise, it seems that the neuromuscular profile depends on the subject's training background and the contraction modes used to assess fatigue. ©2007The American College of Sports Medicine.","Coactivation; Electromyography; M<sub>max</sub>; Maximal voluntary activation; Twitch contractile properties","Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Electromyography; Exercise; Exercise Test; France; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fatigue; adult; article; athlete; concentric muscle contraction; controlled study; cycling; eccentric muscle contraction; electromyography; endurance; extensor muscle; human; human experiment; isokinetic exercise; isometric exercise; knee; male; muscle twitch; muscle weakness; range of motion; statistical significance; torque; training; voluntary movement","","","","","","","BABAULT N., POUSSON M., BALLAY Y., VAN HOECKE J., Activation of human quadriceps femoris during isometric, concentric, and eccentric contractions, J.

The main goals were (1) to understand vegetation dynamics, and (2) to represent how main agents, or actors view the dynamics of natural resources in relation to their own living practices. The management strategies established for each type of stakeholders were formalised and the impact of these strategies on biodiversity was analyzed at various temporal and spatial scales. Following a short description of the model, three aspects of the modelling process are discussed in more detail: the use of the chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) population as a representative variable for the interactions between stakeholders and territory, the use of non-monetary economic indicators, and the ways that multi-disciplinary scientific knowledge can be integrated into the model. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based model; Biodiversity; Biosphere Reserve; Companion modelling; Shrub encroachment; Social dynamics","Bretagne; Finistere; France; Ouessant; Ovis aries; Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax; Biodiversity; Biospherics; Computational methods; Economics; Multi agent systems; Agent-based model; Biosphere reserve; Companion modelling; Shrub encroachment; Social dynamics; biodiversity; environmental modeling; grass; management practice; natural resource; nature reserve; numerical model; passerine; sheep; shrub; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; strategic approach; vegetation dynamics; Dynamics","","","","","French Institute for Biodiversity","This study was carried out within the framework of a project on “Organisation of access to resources and biodiversity applied to the French Biosphere Reserves”, funded by the French Institute for Biodiversity.","Athanasiadis I.N., Milis M., Mitkas P.A., Michaelides S.C., A multi-agent system for meteorological radar data management and decision support, Environmental Modelling & Software, 24, 11, pp. 1264-1273, (2009); Bellec S., Pratiques et représentations de la friche des résidents secondaires sur l'île d'Ouessant, Rapport, Master d'Ethnologie, (2005); Bithell M., Brasington J., Coupling agent-based models of subsistence farming with individual-based forest models and dynamic models of water distribution, Environmental Modelling & Software, 24, 2, pp. 173-190, (2009); Bousquet F., Bakam I., Proton H., Le Page C., Cormas: common-pool resources and multi-agent systems, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 1416, pp. 826-838, (1998); Charles M., Chlous-Ducharme F., Faugere E., Wintz M., 2, (2008); Collectif ComMod, Modélisation d'accompagnement, Modélisation et simulation multi-agents pour les sciences de l'homme et de la société, pp. 241-252, (2006); Tourism, Biodiversity and Information, (2002); Diaz M., Campos P., Pulido F.J., The Spanish dehesas: a diversity in land-use and wildlife, Farming and Birds in Europe: The Common Agricultural Policy and its Implications for Bird Conservation, pp. 331-357, (1997); Etienne M., Le Page C., Cohen M., A step-by-step approach to building land management scenarios based on multiple viewpoints on multi-agent system simulations, Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 6, 2, (2003); Etienne M., Companion modelling: a tool for dialog and concertation in biosphere reserves.

Sprint stages were classified as won, lost, or dropped from the front bunch before the sprint. Thirty-one stages were video-analyzed for average speed of the last km, sprint duration, position in the bunch, and number of teammates at 60, 30, and 15 s remaining. Race distance, total elevation gain (TEG), and average speed of 45 stages were determined. Head-to-head performances against the 2nd-5th most successful professional sprint cyclists were also reviewed. In the 52 Grand Tour sprint stages the subject started, he won 30 (58%), lost 15 (29%), was dropped in 6 (12%), and had 1 crash. Position in the bunch was closer to the front and the number of team members was significantly higher in won than in lost at 60, 30, and 15 s remaining (P < .05). The sprint duration was not different between won and lost (11.3 ± 1.7 and 10.4 ± 3.2 s). TEG was significantly higher in dropped (1089 ± 465 m) than in won and lost (574 ± 394 and 601 ± 423 m, P < .05). The ability to finish the race with the front bunch was lower (77%) than that of other successful sprinters (89%). However, the subject was highly successful, winning over 60% of contested stages, while his competitors won less than 15%.

The system features the following functions: Bike route planning, navigation, and route recommendation and covers the following operational modes; the shortest route planning, easiest route planning and hardest route planning. The shortest route planning simply considers the whole route length as the objective cost. The easiest and hardest route planning considers both altitude and length of the route. A combination of the altitude and route length is converted to the slope of the Tour of France for evaluation of the bike route difficulty ratings. Geographic information of the Da-Keng mountain area in Taichung City has been utilized as a testing platform for realization of the proposed route planning method. Real-world tests have been conducted for demonstration.","3D route planning; Cycle sport; Navigation","Navigation; Electronic map; Geographic information; Novel route; Operational modes; Real-world tests; Route length; Route planning; System features; Testing platforms; Bicycles","","","","","","","Yung N.H.C., Ye C., An Intelligent Mobile Vehicle Navigator Based on Fuzzy Logic and Reinforcement Learning, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part B: Cybernetics, 29, 2, pp. 314-321, (1999); Bajaj R., Ranaweera S.L., Agrawal D.P., GPS: Location-Tracking Technology, IEEE Computer, 35, 4, pp. 92-94, (2002); Soehren W., Hawkinson W., Prototype Personal Navigation System, IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 23, 4, pp. 10-18, (2008); (2009); (2009); (2008); (2006); (2002); (2005); (2008); Dijkstra E.W., A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs, Numerische Mathematik, 1, 1, pp. 269-271, (1959); Li X.Y., Li G.S., Zhang S.T., Routing Space Internet Based on Dijkstra's Algorithm, First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet, pp. 1-4, (2009); Misa T.J., Interview: An Interview with Edsger W, Dijkstra.

Petrarch's ascent of the Mont Ventoux in 1336, or rather his account of it, established the mountain as a distinctive place for experiencing and understanding nature and self. Since then, the mountain has been sought out in increasing numbers by those pursuing spiritual elevation, bodily exertion, and/or scientific investigation. To this day, a pilgrimage church, several hotels, and an observatory are characteristically perched atop Mont Ventoux.

It then became critical for the City of Paris to understand both the mechanisms leading to traffic accidents involving at least one powered two-wheelers user and the perception of their risk when riding in dense urban areas. In so doing, two studies were carried out along similar lines so that their results could be compared. The first study focused on the perception of situations where accidents are most likely to occur. The second one was an analysis of police reports of accidents involving at least one powered two-wheelers and the drawing-up of prototypical accident scenarios. Comparing the results of the two studies revealed a gap between perceived and objective risks of these users. In fact, they rather fear the situations during which a car driver is changing lanes, while accidents involving them occur more often when a car driver turns (right, left or U). Knowledge of this dissonance in terms of awareness of road risks for powered two-wheelers and equally, other road users, will give the City of Paris food for thought. The promising results of this study have encouraged the City of Paris to extend it to other types of users, such as cyclists or elderly pedestrians. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Dense urban areas; Powered two-wheelers; Prototypical accident scenarios; Risk perception","Accidents, Traffic; Attitude to Health; Automobile Driving; Chi-Square Distribution; Humans; Motorcycles; Paris; Questionnaires; Risk; Safety; Urban Health; Highway accidents; Motor transportation; Accident scenarios; Car driver; Changing lanes; Dense urban areas; Police reports; Powered two-wheelers; Road risk; Road users; article; attitude to health; car driving; chi square distribution; comparative study; France; health; human; motorcycle; psychological aspect; questionnaire; risk; safety; statistics; traffic accident; Risk perception","","","","","","","Berlyne D.E., Incertitude et curiosité, Psychologie Française, 1, pp. 119-129, (1970); Blomart J., Le goût du risque: Etude expérimentale d'une suite de choix dans l'incertitude, Bulletin du C.E.R.P., XII, 4, pp. 359-368, (1963); Brenac T., L'analyse séquentielle de l'accident de la route (Méthode INRETS), Comment la mettre en pratique dans les diagnostics de sécurité routière, Rapport INRETS, Outils et Méthodes N° 3, (1997); Brenac T., Fleury D., Le concept de scénario type d'accident de la circulation et ses applications, Recherche Transports Sécurité, 63, pp. 63-76, (1999); Brenac T., Nachtergaele C., Reigner H., Scénarios types d'accidents impliquant des piétons et éléments pour leur prévention, Rapport INRETS N° 256, (2003); Sécurité des Déplacements en Agglomération: Guide Méthodologique N° 63, (2007); Clabaux N., Brenac T., Deux-roues motorisés en ville: Scénarios types d'accidents, influence de l'aménagement et perspectives pour la prévention, Transport, Environnement, Circulation, 185, pp. 16-21, (2005); Clabaux N., Prevention of traffic accidents involving powered two-wheelers in urban areas: Prototypical accident scenarios and prospects for the planning and design of the urban road infrastructure, Proceedings of the European Transport Conference 2007, (2007); Delignieres D., Risque perçu et apprentissage moteur, Apprentissage Moteur: Rôle des Représentations, pp. 157-171, (1991); Fleury D., Brenac T., Accident prototypical scenarios, a tool for road safety research and diagnostic studies, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 33, 2, pp. 267-276, (2001); Fuller R., A conceptualisation of driving behaviour as threat avoidance, Ergonomics, 27, 11, pp. 1139-1155, (1984); Guyot R., Gisements de Sécurité Routière - Les Deux-roues Motorisés, (2008); Howarth C.I., The relationship between objective risk, subjective risk, and behaviour, Ergonomics, 31, 4, pp. 527-535, (1988); Hurt H.H., Ouellet J.V., Thom D.R., Motorcycle Accident Cause Factors and Identification of Countermeasures, Volume 1: Technical Report, (1981); MacE R., Physiological arousal in climbers, Physical Education Review, 2, 2, pp. 141-149, (1979); Maestracci M., Prochasson F., Analytical Grid to Analyze Road Accidents in Paris; De Paris M., Charte 2RM et Guide des Bonnes Pratiques, (2007); Mairie de Paris, Observatoire de la Mobilité, (2010); Naatanen R., Summala H., A model for the role of motivational factors in drivers' decision-making, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 6, pp. 243-261, (1976); Peccoud F., Les Usagers de Deux-roues Motorisés Circulant À Paris et Leur Perception du Risqu'; Robaye F., Hubert J., Decroly L., Estimation de la probabilité et de la gravité des accidents.

A wind tunnel and metric balance were used to measure the drag force (Fd) and wind tunnel air velocity on cylinders, limb models, and live cyclists clad in samples or suits sewn with one or more of 200 stretch fabrics. A concurrent measurement of model dimensions and frontal areas provided the non‐dimensional drag coefficient (Cd) and Reynolds Numbers (Re) that characterized the ability of the various fabrics and suits to reduce frictional drag and induce a drag crisis (DC) or premature flow transition. DC defines a critical air velocity over the body segments at which the airflow transitions from laminar to turbulent, yielding a smaller wake behind the body segment and a corresponding decrease in Fd. A number of fabrics triggered DC on cylinders and limb segments, reducing cylinder and limb Cd by over 40 per cent. Several methods of lowering the Fd of cycling apparel proved effective, including custom fitting, aligning seams with the airflow, and matching fabric textures to body segments. Repeated drag measurements of the same cycling suit provided a mean drag of approximately 3200 g with a standard error of ± 29g. The final 2005 individual TT suit design, worn by a pedaling cyclist, had a measured drag at 53kph, which was 125 g less than typical 2001 TT cycling suits worn by competitors (Fd reduction 5 3.9 per cent). A mathematical model predicts that a drag difference of this magnitude would provide a time saving of approximately 44 s in a 55‐km Tour de France TT. In 2002–2005 and 2007, the production version of the ‘Swift Spin’ TT suit was worn by the winner of the Tour de France; by the women's hour record holder and by road; TT and track cyclists who set four world records, six Olympic records, and won seven medals in individual cycling races at the 2004 Athens Olympics. © 2009, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","aerodynamic drag; flow transition; NIKE Swift Spin; TT suit; zoned fabrics","","","","","","Nike Inc.","This research was funded by Nike Inc.","Kyle C.R., Improving the racing bicycle, Mechanical Engineering, 106, 11, pp. 34-45, (1984); Kyle C.R., Weaver M.D., Aerodynamics of human‐powered vehicles, Proceedings of the Mech E Part A Journal of Power and Energy, 218, pp. 1-14, (2004); Bassett D.R., Kyle C.R., Passfield L., Broker J., Burke E.R., Comparing cycling world hour records, 1967–1996: modeling with empirical data, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 31, 11, pp. 1665-1676, (1999); Kyle C.R., Fast fashion: the aerodynamics of bicycle clothing, Bicycling, 26, 5, pp. 118-124, (1985); Kyle C.R., Caiozzo V.J., The effect of athletic clothing aerodynamics upon running speed, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 18, 5, pp. 509-515, (1986); Brownlie L., Mekjavic I., Gartshore I., Mutch B., Banister E., The influence of apparel on aerodynamic drag in running, Annals of Physiological Anthropology, 6, pp. 133-143, (1987); Brownlie L., Aerodynamic characteristics of sports apparel (Dissertation), (1992); Kyle C.R., Athletic clothing, Scientific American, 254, pp. 104-110, (1986); Kyle C.R., Brownlie L.W., Harber E., MacDonald R., Shorten M.R., The Nike Swift Spin cycling project: reducing the aerodynamic drag of bicycle racing clothing by using zoned fabrics, The Engineering of Sport 5, pp. 118-123, (2004); Brownlie L.W., Kyle C.R., Harber E., MacDonald R., Shorten M.R., Reducing the aerodynamic drag of sports apparel: Development of the NIKE Swift sprint running and SwiftSkin speed skating suits, The Engineering of Sport 5, pp. 90-96, (2004); Brownlie L.W., Gartshore I., Chapman A., Bannister E.W., The aerodynamics of cycling apparel, Cycling Science, 3, 3-4, pp. 44-50, (1991); Hoerner S.F., Fluid dynamic drag, (1965)","L.

Although a champion cyclist in 1-day events prior to his diagnosis of testicular cancer at age 25, he was not a contender in multi-day endurance cycle races such as the 3-week Tour de France. His genetic makeup and physiology (high over(V, ̇)O2 max, long femur, strong heavy build) coupled with his ambition and motivation enabled him at an early age to become one of the best 1-day cyclists in the world. Following his cancer diagnosis, he underwent a unilateral orchiectomy, brain surgery and four cycles of chemotherapy. After recovering, he returned to cycling and surprisingly excelled in the Tour de France, winning this hardest of endurance events 7 years running. This dramatic transformation from a 1-day to a 3-week endurance champion has led many to query how this is possible, and under the current climate, has led to suggestions of doping as to the answer to this metamorphosis. Physiological tests following his recovery indicated that physiological parameters such as over(V, ̇)O2 max were not affected by the unilateral orchiectomy and chemotherapy. We propose that his dramatic improvement in recovery between stages, the most important factor in winning multi-day stage races, is due to his unilateral orchiectomy, a procedure that results in permanent changes in serum hormones. These hormonal changes, specifically an increase in gonadotropins (and prolactin) required to maintain serum testosterone levels, alter fuel metabolism; increasing hormone sensitive lipase expression and activity, promoting increased free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization to, and utilization by, muscles, thereby decreasing the requirement to expend limiting glycogen stores before, during and after exercise. Such hormonal changes also have been associated with ketone body production, improvements in muscle repair and haematocrit levels and may facilitate the loss of body weight, thereby increasing power to weight ratio. Taken together, these hormonal changes act to limit glycogen utilization, delay fatigue and enhance recovery thereby allowing for optimal performances on a day-to-day basis. These insights provide the foundation for future studies on the endocrinology of exercise metabolism, and suggest that Lance Armstrong's athletic advantage was not due to drug use. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand basic differences among participants according to the severity of the race, participants in qualifying events for two ultra-endurance cycling races, differing in length and intensity, were compared on measures of anthropometry, training, and support. One race was four times longer, required supporting teams, and racers typically had little sleep, which should lead to the qualifiers being substantially more highly trained than those from the shorter race. The qualifiers in the longer race had greater intensity in training while the qualifiers in the shorter race relied more on training volume. Different strategies and types of training reflected the different demands of the races. Future studies should evaluate personality and motivational differences in ultra-endurance events and between these athletes and athletes in other sports. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2012.","","Achievement;

Twenty-four MTB and 24 RC (off-road Olympics, world, continental and national champions, Tour-de-France participants, on-road world cup race winner) volunteered to answer a questionnaire about the characteristics of cycling practice and perform a sensory organization test, aiming to evaluate balance control in 6 different sensory situations based upon visual and support surface perturbations (C1ES to C6ES). RC balance performances were better than those of MTB both during quiet stance eyes opened (C1ES, p = 0.011) and when only somatosensory information is disrupted (C4ES, p = 0.039), highlighting a higher use of vision to control balance in RC. Moreover, a positive correlation was shown in the whole population (MTB + RC) between the visual ratio (RVIS = C4ES/C1ES) and the proportion of riding distance of on-road cycling (ρ = 0.28, p = 0.054). In MTB, the use of proprioception (somatosensory ratio: RSOM = C2ES(eyes closed)/C1ES) was increased by a higher intensity of off-road cycling (ρ = 0.49, p = 0.018) and that of vision (RVIS) by a higher intensity of on-road cycling (ρ = 0.41, p = 0.048). The difference in sensory organization between MTB and RC could be explained by adaptive processes elaborated from environmental stimulations and technical specificities of these disciplines. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: We collected data in professional cyclists from the first TT of the 1998 Tour de France (TT1, 58 km distance; n = 6 cyclists) and the first (TT2, 56.5 km; n = 5) and second TT of the 1999 Tour de France (TT3, 57 km; n = 5). Results: A negative relationship was found between power output (W) at VT (VTWatt) and TT final time (s) in TT1 (r=-0.864; p=0.026; standard error of estimate (SEE) of 73 s; and 95% confidence limits (95% CL) -0.98; -0.18), TT2 (r=-0.77; p=0.27; SEE of 139 s; and 95% CL-0.98; 0.35), and TT3 (r=-0.923; p=0.025; SEE of 94 s; and 95% CL -1.00; -0.22). Conclusions: Actual performance in long TT during the Tour de France (>50 km distance, performed after at least 1-2 weeks of continuous competition), in which some cumulative fatigue inevitably occurs, is related, at least in part, to the power output that elicits the VT. No other routine physiological variable (for example, VO2max or Wpeak) is related to performance in this type of event.","","Adult; Bicycling; Ergometry; Exercise; Humans; Oxygen Consumption; Regression (Psychology);

Blasco Ibañez 15, Spain","It is widely held among the general population and even among health professionals that moderate exercise is a healthy practice but long term high intensity exercise is not. The specific amount of physical activity necessary for good health remains unclear. To date, longevity studies of elite athletes have been relatively sparse and the results are somewhat conflicting. The Tour de France is among the most gruelling sport events in the world, during which highly trained professional cyclists undertake high intensity exercise for a full 3 weeks. Consequently we set out to determine the longevity of the participants in the Tour de France, compared with that of the general population. We studied the longevity of 834 cyclists from France (n=465), Italy (n=196) and Belgium (n=173) who rode the Tour de France between the years 1930 and 1964. Dates of birth and death of the cyclists were obtained on December 31st 2007. We calculated the percentage of survivors for each age and compared them with the values for the pooled general population of France, Italy and Belgium for the appropriate age cohorts. We found a very significant increase in average longevity (17%) of the cyclists when compared with the general population. The age at which 50% of the general population died was 73.5 vs. 81.5 years in Tour de France participants. Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners. Our findings underpin the importance of exercising without the fear that becoming exhausted might be bad for one's health. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.","endurance; life expectancy; lifestyle; mortality; physical activity","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Athletes; Belgium; Bicycling; Case-Control Studies; France; Humans; Italy; Longevity; Male; aged; article; athlete; Belgium; bicycle; case control study; France; human; Italy; longevity; male; statistics","","","","","","","Blair S.N., Lamonte M.J., Nichaman M.Z., The evolution of physical activity recommendations: How much is enough, Am J Clin Nutr, 79, (2004); Chakravarty E.F., Hubert H.B., Lingala V.B., Fries J.F., Reduced disability and mortality among aging runners: A 21-year longitudinal study, Arch Intern Med, 168, pp. 1638-1646, (2008); Church T.S., Earnest C.P., Skinner J.S., Blair S.N., Effects of different doses of physical activity oncardiorespiratory fitness among sedentary, overweight or obese postmenopausal women with elevated blood pressure: A randomized controlled trial, Journal of the American Medical Association, 297, 19, pp. 2081-2091, (2007); Fogelholm M., Kaprio J., Sarna S., Healthy lifestyles of former Finnish world class athletes, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 26, 2, pp. 224-229, (1994); Gomez-Cabrera M.-C., Pallardo F.V., Sastre J., Vina J., Garcia-Del-Moral L., Allopurinol and Markers of Muscle Damage among Participants in the Tour de France [4], Journal of the American Medical Association, 289, 19, pp. 2503-2504, (2003); Harris K.M., Henry J.T., Rohman E., Haas T.S., Maron B.J., Sudden death during the triathlon, JAMA, 303, pp. 1255-1257, (2010); Harriss D.J., Atkinson G., International Journal of Sports Medicine Ethical Standards in Sport and Exercise Science Research, Int J Sports Med, 30, pp. 701-702, (2009); Kesaniemi Y.A., Danforth E.

It examines how and why the Church overcame its initial reticence to embrace sport and turn it into a fundamental pillar of an alternative culture that challenged the monopoly of national sporting federations. Following the rise of Fascism, sport became one of the principal means by which the Church resisted a complete takeover by the regime. Analysis of the devout Catholic cyclist Gino Bartali reveals how the Church maintained its identity and tradition of sporting independence despite the inevitable suppression of Catholic sporting organisations. Culminating in an examination of the 'immortalisation' of Bartali after his win in the 1948 Tour De France-a victory popularly credited with saving Italy from civil war-the article illuminates the processes by which sport became a central feature of Catholicism in national life. It highlights the Church's contribution to the development of Italian sport, assesses the wider impact of sport's role in forming alternative cultures, and argues that sport perfectly positioned the Church to respond to the demands of Reconstruction Italy and provided opportunities to secure a post-war Christian Democratic society. © 2011 Academia Europaea.","","Italy; Catholicism; church role; cultural history; cultural identity; cultural tradition; post-war; social impact; sport","","","","","Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC, (AH/F019971/1)","","La Bicicletta e l'Anarchia, (1894); I Ciclofobi, (1894); Il Velocipede e Il Sacerdozio. i Preti in Bicicletta, (1894); Kertzer D.I., Religion and society, 1789-1892, Italy in the Nineteenth Century 1796-1900, (2000); Battista Gandolfo G., Vassallo L., Lo Sport Nei Documenti Pontifici, (1994); Cronaca Contemporanea, 4, pp. 211-212, (1905); Munoz L., The birth of an international Catholic federation: A European matter, 1905-11, The International Journal of the History of Sport, 26, 1, pp. 3-20, (2009); La Violenza Settaria Degli Anticlericali di Roma Contro Una Tranquilla Manifestzione di Fede e di Forza, (1913); Serata di Dimostrazioni A Roma, (1913); Commenti Alla Proibizione Del Corteo Ginnastico Cattolico, (1913); La Cronaca della Mattinata FASCI, (1913); Fabrizio F., Storia Dello Sport in Italia.

The aim of our study therefore was to measure blood samples and compare the results obtained on the field with those obtained in the laboratory. For this it was necessary to have blood samples analysed with different instruments to determine the exactness of the results and evaluate the performances of these instruments in order to validate the haematological testing used to reveal athletes abusing recombinant erythropoietin. We report on the haematological analysis of 177 professional cyclists who took part in the Tour de France 2001. All the blood samples were withdrawn in the morning between 7 and 9 am in Dunkerque (France) and were analysed immediately with a transportable analyser. Then the samples were flown to Lausanne (Switzerland) and were reanalysed in two independent ISO 17025 accredited laboratories with three different analysers. The results confirmed that the most effective haematological follow-up should be performed under standardized pre-analytical conditions and with identical analysers of the same manufacturer to avoid too many variations notably on the haematocrit level and the reticulocyte count. Furthermore, this study suggests that analyses performed on the site are good and could enable the federations to perform a urinary test to detect rhEPO abuse right after the blood analysis. This time saving is essential to fight efficiently recombinant erythropoietin doping, because the half life of the hormone is very short.","Cyclist; Doping; Haemoglobin; Hematocrit; Reticulocyte","Bicycling; Blood Preservation; Erythropoietin, Recombinant; France; Hematocrit; Hemoglobins; Humans; Linear Models; Reticulocyte Count; novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein; recombinant erythropoietin; article; athlete; blood analysis; cycling; doping; drug half life; follow up; France; hematocrit; human; male; reticulocyte count; Switzerland; urinalysis","","recombinant erythropoietin, 113427-24-0, 122312-54-3, 130455-76-4; Erythropoietin, Recombinant, ; Hemoglobins, ","aranesp; eprex; recormon","","","","Gore C.J., Parisotto R., Ashenden M.J., Stray-Gundersen J., Sharpe K., Hopkins W., Et al., Second-generation blood tests to detect erythropoietin abuse by athletes, Haematologica, 88, pp. 333-344, (2003); Heins M., Schossow B., Greiner L., Heil W., Influence of storage time and temperature on haematological measurands using a Sysmex NE 8000 analyser, Medical Laboratory Science, 24, pp. 236-242, (2000); Lasne F., De Ceaurriz J., Recombinant erythropoietin in urine, Nature, 405, (2000); Leppanen E.A., Grasbeck R., Experimental basis of standardized specimen collection: Effect of posture on blood picture, Eur J Haematol, 40, pp. 222-226, (1988); Parisotto R., Gore C.J., Emslie K.R., Ashenden M.J., Brugnara C., Et al., A novel method utilising markers of altered erythropoiesis for the detection of recombinant human erythropoietin abuse in athletes, Haematologica, 85, pp. 564-572, (2000); Parisotto R., Wu M., Ashenden M.J., Emslie K.R., Gore C.J., Howe C., Et al., Detection of recombinant human erythropoietin abuse in athletes utilizing markers of altered erythropoiesis, Haematologica, 86, pp. 128-137, (2001); Riley R.S., Ben Ezra J.M., Goel R., Tidwell A., Reticulocytes and reticulocyte enumeration, J Clin Lab Anal, 15, pp. 267-294, (2001); Robinson N., Mangin P., Schattenberg L., Saugy M., Origine du suivi hématologique: Les contrôles hématocrites dans le cyclisme, Revue Française des Laboratoires, 350, pp. 53-59, (2003); Robinson N., Saugy M., Mangin P., Effects of exercise on the secondary blood markers commonly used to suspect erythropoietin doping, Clin Lab, 49, pp. 57-62, (2003); Saugy M., Robinson N., Pfister Y., Mangin P., One years' experiment with the blood screening test to fight against rhEPO doping, Recent Advances in Doping Analysis, 10, pp. 159-168, (2003); Communiqué de Presse de l'Union Cycliste Internationale Effectué le 30 Mars 2001 à Lausanne Concernant l'Introduction du Test EPO dans les Urines, (2001); Van Den B.J., Devreese K., Malfait R., Van D.V., Wauters A., Neeis H., Et al., Reference intervals for a complete blood count determined on different automated haematology analysers: Abx Pentra 120 Retic, Coulter Gen-S, Sysmex SE 9500, Abbott Cell Dyn 4000 and Bayer Advia 120, Clin Chem Lab Med, 40, pp. 69-73, (2002); Van Der M.W., Dinnissen J., Keijzer M., Evaluation of the Sysmex XT-2000i, a new automated haematology analyser, Sysmex J Intern, 12, pp. 71-75, (2002)","N.

One of the key benefits of using ultramarine blue in coatings is that it provides a unique red shade blue, unlike phthalocyanine, indanthrene or cobalt blues. S o ultramarine blue provides an opportunity to give brands or products a distinct and unique color differentiation, important in today's highly competitive consumer and industrial markets. Another potential disadvantage of using ultramarine blue is its transparency, but in some circumstances this can be a considerable advantage. The most popular uses of ultramarines in coatings currently are in architectural, decorative interior applications and powder coatings. Other applications include motorbike/bike paints and coil coatings. Driving this change in perception are the two producers, Holliday Pigments and Nubiola.","","Cobalt; Barcelona , Spain; Cobalt blue; Coil coatings; Industrial markets; Other applications; Ultramarine blue; Ultramarine blue pigment; Ultramarine pigments; Powder coatings","","","","","","","","C.

Background Knowledge of cardiac changes in athletes, who are at particularly high risk of sudden cardiac death, is mandatory to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy. Methods We carried out echocardiographic examinations on 286 cyclists (group A) and 52 matched sedentary volunteers (group C); 148 cyclists participated in the 1995 ""Tour de France"" race (group A1), 138 in the 1998 race (group A2), and 37 in both (group B). Results In groups A, A1, A2, and C, respectively, diastolic left ventricular diameter (LVID) was 60.1 ± 3.9 mm, 59.2 ± 3.8 mm, 61.0 ± 3.9 mm, and 49.0 ± 4.3 mm (A vs. C and A1 vs. A2, p < 0.0001), and maximal wall thickness (WT) was 11.1 ± 1.3 mm, 11.6 ± 1.3 mm, 10.6 ± 1.1 mm, and 8.6 ± 1.0 mm (A vs. C and A1 vs. A2, p < 0.0001). Among group A, 147 (51.4%) had LVID >60 mm; 17 of them had also a below normal (<52%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Wall thickness exceeded 13 mm in 25 athletes (8.7%) (always <15 mm), 23 with LVID >55 mm. In group B, LVID increased (58.3 ± 4.8 mm to 60.3 ± 4.2 mm, p < 0.001) and WT decreased (11.8 ± 1.2 mm to 10.8 ± 1.2 mm, p < 0.001) with time. Conclusions Over one-half of these athletes exhibited unusual LV dilation, along with a reduced LVEF in 11.6% (17 of 147), compatible with the diagnosis of DCM. Increased WT was less common (always <15 mm) and scarce without LV dilation (<1%), eliminating the diagnosis of HCM. Serial examinations showed evidence of further LV dilation along with wall thinning. These results might have important implications for screening in athletes. © 2004 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.","body surface area; BSA; DCM; dilated cardiomyopathy; eFS; endocardial fractional shortening; ESS; HCM; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; left ventricle/ventricular; left ventricular ejection fraction; LV; LVEF; LVH; meridional end-systolic stress","Adult; Bicycling; Blood Pressure; Body Surface Area; Diastole; Echocardiography; Follow-Up Studies; France; Heart Rate; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Male; Mass Screening; Statistics; Stroke Volume; Systole; Ventricular Function, Left; adult; article; athlete; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; cycling; diagnostic approach route; echocardiography; endurance; female; heart left ventricle compliance; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle filling; heart left ventricle muscle; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; physical stress; priority journal; thickness","","","","","","","Pelliccia A., Maron B.J., Outer limits of the athlete's heart, the effect of gender, and relevance to the differential diagnosis with primary cardiac diseases, Cardiol Clin, 15, pp. 381-396, (1997); Pluim B.M., Zwinderman A.H., Van Der Laarse A., Van Der Wall E.E., The athlete's heart: A meta-analysis of cardiac structure and function, Circulation, 101, pp. 336-344, (2000); Kennedy M.C., Newer drugs used to enhance sporting performance, Med J Aust, 173, pp. 314-317, (2000); Birkeland K.I., Stray-Gundersen J., Hemmersbach P., Hallen J., Haug E., Bahr R., Effect of rhEPO administration on serum levels of sTfR and cycling performance, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 1238-1243, (2000); Abergel E., Linhart A., Chatellier G., Et al., Vascular and cardiac remodeling in world class professional cyclists, Am Heart J, 136, pp. 818-823, (1998); Devereux R.B., Liebson P.R., Horan M.J., Recommendations concerning the use of echocardiography in hypertension and general population research, Hypertension, 9, SUPPL.

Purpose: To evaluate whether the LV morphologic and functional alterations responsible for this increase in cardiac filling are similar in children and young adults. Methods: Standard echocardiography (LV morphology and function) and tissue Doppler imaging (LV relaxation properties) were assessed in 10 adult cyclists, 13 age-matched sedentary controls, 12 boy cyclists, and 11 untrained boys. Results: In our endurance-trained adults, LV morphological adaptations included increase in LV internal diameters, wall thickness, and mass. However, effects associated with training on LV morphology were different in children because no true cardiac hypertrophy was observed in our child cyclists compared with age-matched nonactive boys. Effects related training on LV systolic and diastolic function assessed by TDI were similar in boys and men. The LV diastolic function was improved in trained subjects (i.e., increased transmitral early to late filling velocities) as a result of an increase in LV relaxation properties. However, LV filling pressures, estimated from TDI, were similar in trained individuals compared with age-matched controls. Conclusion: In both children and adults, an increase in LV relaxation properties and normal LV filling pressures in endurance-trained subjects might be taken as additional indicators for a physiologic or ""normal"" hypertrophy. However, further investigations are needed to evaluate whether the specific LV morphological adaptation observed in trained-children reflects a blunted trained-induced cardiac hypertrophy before puberty.","Diastolic function; Echocardiography; Endurance training; Left ventricle; Prepubertal children; Relaxation properties","Adult; Bicycling; Case-Control Studies; Child; Echocardiography; France; Humans; Ventricular Function, Left; adult; article; blood pressure; body surface; controlled study; cycling; Doppler echocardiography; endurance; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle filling; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart rate; heart stroke volume; human; human experiment; M mode echocardiography; male; normal human; prepuberty; preschool child; two dimensional echocardiography","","","","","","","Appleton C.P., Hatle L.K., Popp R.L., Relation of transmitral flow velocity patterns to left ventricular diastolic function: New insights from a combined hemodynamic and Doppler echocardiographic study, J.

Asthma affecting elite athletes has been studied mainly in subjects practicing winter sports. The aim of our study was to test the pulmonary function in order to evaluate bronchial hyper-responsiveness prevalence in a team of 25 male professional cyclists (27.9±3.9 years old with a V̇O2max equal to 69.9±6.6 mL·min -1·kg-1). Methods. Using a questionnaire that queried the presence or absence of asthma history or common symptoms of exercise induced bronchospasm, 72% of the subjects had upper airway or bronchial symptoms. Using a pneumotachograph, we recorded a forced flow-volume curve at rest, after a maximal exercise test with ambient air, and after β2-agonist inhalation, then during a methacholine challenge. Results. In our study, 52% of the subjects showed clinical symptoms associated with bronchial responsiveness during methacholine test, a proportion which is much higher than the average population (3-20%). However, ERS-ATS pulmonary function testing criteria at rest (reduced FEZ1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75%) were not fulfilled by any of them. In the asthmatic group, O2max was significantly higher (70.5±6 vs 68.6±8.2 mL·min-1·kg-1, P<0.05). This remained true for submaximal loads suggesting that ventilation energy cost related to bronchial hyper-responsiveness was also higher. Conclusion. We have reported in this study that professional cyclists have a far higher prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness than the average population, which can be regarded as a real health issue.","Asthma;

In order to improve the modelling of inclusion criteria for studies of SCI it is necessary to determine what epidemiological trends affect SCI. Using the Rhone Registry, which contains all the casualties resulting from road crashes in the Rhône département of France and codes their injuries using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), we describe the epidemiological trends that affect spinal cord injury (SCI), major spinal trauma (MST) and severe injuries (AIS4+) to other body regions between two periods 1996-2001 and 2003-2008. Although there has been a marked decrease (35%) in the incidence of casualties after a road traffic crash, and reductions of 22% in the incidence of MST and 33% in that of severe injuries (AIS4+) (p<0.001), for SCI the incidence rate and number of casualties have remained surprisingly stable. In the second period, there was no change in the incidence of SCI resulting from road traffic crashes, nor in the associated fatality, mortality and survival rates. The incidence for car users was significantly lower in the second period. This contrasts with the incidences for motorcyclists and for the group including pedestrians and cyclists which were respectively 47% and 77% higher in the second period. The median age of the casualties, the age-adjusted incidence of SCI and the number of associated injuries were also higher in the second period. We have observed a marked reduction in the incidence of road trauma including the most severe injuries, but not SCI. The higher proportion of motorcyclists, the increase in the age of casualties and the greater presence of multiple injuries are new factors in the epidemiology of SCI after a road crash. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","epidemiology; road crash; spinal cord injury; spine; trauma; trend","Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Automobiles; Bicycling; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; France; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Motorcycles; Paraparesis; Quadriplegia; Registries; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal Fractures; Spine; Survival; Young Adult; adult; age distribution; article; car driving; controlled study; cycling; disease registry; fatality; female; France; human; incidence; injury scale; major clinical study; male; mortality; motorcycle; pedestrian; spinal cord injury; survival rate; traffic accident; trend study","","","","","","","Ankarath S., Giannoudis P.V., Barlow I., Bellamy M.C., Matthews S.J., Smith R.M., Injury patterns associated with mortality following motorcycle crashes, Injury, 33, 6, pp. 473-477, (2002); The Abbreviated Injury Scale, 1990 Revision, (1990); Baaj A.A., Uribe J.S., Nichols T.A., Theodore N., Crawford N.R., Sonntag V.K., Vale F.L., Health care burden of cervical spine fractures in the United States: Analysis of a nationwide database over a 10-year period, J Neurosurg Spine, 13, pp. 61-66, (2010); Catz A., Thaleisnik M., Fishel B., Ronen J., Spasser R., Fredman B., Shabtay E., Gepstein R., Survival following spinal cord injury in Israel, Spinal Cord, 40, 11, pp. 595-598, (2002); DeVivo M.J., Krause J.S., Lammertse D.P., Recent trends in mortality and causes of death among persons with spinal cord injury, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 80, 11, pp. 1411-1419, (1999); Farmer C.M., Williams A.F., Temporal factors in motor vehicle crash deaths, Injury Prevention, 11, 1, pp. 18-23, (2005); Gadegbeku B., Chiron M., Ndiaye A., Laumon B., Road traffic casualties: What trends?

Concepts and concomitant interpretations of place as a 'situated' and contemplative experience have to date received much cultural geographical attention. In increasingly mobile societies, however, I argue that mobility should be central to the ways in which we conceptualise and understand the character and meanings of different spaces and places. Although geographical exploration has begun concerning the politics and power relations of the mobile subject, little attention has yet been paid to the experiences and spatialities generative of the body-subject in mobility. Whilst acknowledging the importance of representations in directing action, I strategically emphasise and explore the notion that we create meaning and belong in a place according to how we are in a place. Drawing upon ethnographic work with racing and touring cyclists in the United Kingdom and France, I consider how the conjoining of the person and bike and the resulting embodied rhythms and kinaesthetic sensations of the movement of cycling are constitutive of the character and meanings of particular places. Ultimately, in this paper I point to an understanding of the kinaesthetic and sensuous experiences of the hybrid subject - object (in this instance 'the cyclist') as fundamental in rethinking how people live, feel, and ultimately create meaningful spatial relations.","","Eurasia;

Overall, the findings demonstrate that Internet communication technologies have shifted the nature of parasocial interaction from one-sided and passive to an approximation of actual social interaction and confirm that fans readily interact (para)socially with athletes. © 2009 Western States Communication Association.","Cycling; Floyd Landis; Media effects; Parasocial interaction","","","","","","","","Albert E., Riding a line: Competition and cooperation in the sport of bicycle racing, Sociology of Sport Journal, 8, pp. 341-361, (1991); Albert E., Dealing with danger: The normalization of risk in cycling, International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 34, pp. 157-171, (1999); Arminen I., Closing of turns in the meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous: Members' methods for closing sharing experiences, Research on Language and Social Interaction, 34, 2, pp. 211-251, (2001); Auter P.J., Palmgreen P., Development and validation of a parasocial interaction measure: The audience-persona interaction scale, Communication Research Reports, 17, 1, pp. 79-89, (2000); Bachman G.F., Guerrero L.K., Forgiveness, apology, and communicative responses to hurtful events, Communication Reports, 19, 1, pp. 45-56, (2006); Bartlett M.Y., Desteno D., Gratitude and prosocial behavior, Psychological Science, 17, 4, pp. 319-325, (2006); Basil M.D., Identification as a mediator of celebrity effects, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 40, 4, pp. 478-495, (1996); Batra R., Homer P.M., The situational impact of brand image beliefs, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 14, 3, pp. 318-330, (2004); Baxter L.A., Dun T., Sahlstein E., Rules for relating communicated among social network members, Journal of Social & Personal Relationships, 18, 2, pp. 173-199, (2001); Brewer B.D., Commercialization in professional cycling 1950-2001: Institutional transformations and the rationalization of doping, Sociology of Sport Journal, 19, pp. 276-301, (2002); Brown W.J., Basil M.D., Media celebrities and public health: Responses to Magic Johnson's HIV disclosure and its impact on AIDS risk and high-risk behaviors, Health Communication, 7, 4, pp. 345-370, (1995); Brown W.J., Basil M.D., Bocarnea M.C., The influence of famous athletes on health beliefs and practices: Mark McGwire, child abuse prevention, and androstenedione, Journal of Health Communication, 8, 1, pp. 41-57, (2003); Brown W.J., Duane J.J., Fraser B.P., Media coverage and public opinion of the O.J.

Specific attention was paid to the integration of model components that were sensitive to scaling differences in body mass (mb). The Modern Aero Position model predicted UCI Best Hour performances using predictions of total projected frontal area (AP) that included use of an aerodynamic bicycle and aerodynamic handlebars. The Traditional Racing Position model predicted UCI Hour Record performances using predictions of total AP that include use of a ""Merckx-era"" bicycle with drop-style handlebars. Prediction equations for AP, as well as the coefficient of drag and metabolic power output, involved scaling relationships with mb, while other model components were similar to previously published 1-h models. Both models were solved for the distance cycled in 1 h (DHR) using an iterative strategy. Chris Boardman's current records for the UCI Best Hour Performance (56.375 km) and the UCI Hour Record (49.202 km) were underpredicted by only 0.332 km (-0.6%) and 0.239 km (-0.5%). Both models, regardless of altitude, suggested that DHR should scale with mb to the +0.174 power (DHR∝mb+0.174), which is lower than the +0.32 exponent recently suggested in the literature. Lastly, the same models also predicted that six-time Tour de France winner, Lance Armstrong, could exceed both of Boardman's current records at sea level by about 2.0 km. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Aerodynamics; Bicycle; Bodymass scaling; Modeling; Power output","Adult; Altitude; Bicycling; Body Mass Index; Equipment Design; Forecasting; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Posture; altitude; article; athlete; bicycle; body mass; body size; competition; cycling; human; male; prediction; priority journal; rating scale; sea level; validation process","","","","","","","Astrand P.O., Rodahl K., Textbook of Work Physiology, pp. 391-411, (1986); Bassett D.R., Kyle C.R., Passfield L., Broker J.P., Burke E.R., Comparing cycling world records, 1967-1996: Modeling with empirical data, Med.

This effect was assessed by comparing incidences of injuries (n = 2792 casualties) on the basis of three denominators: the resident population of young people, the number of users of each mode and the distances covered by each mode. The results are presented for each type of road users (pedestrians, car passengers, car drivers, motorised two-wheeler riders, cyclists, public transport users). Young persons from deprived municipalities use motorised-two wheelers, bicycles and the car (as passengers and drivers) less frequently, they walk more and take public transports more often than those from other municipalities. When considering injury risk, motorised two wheeler injuries among adolescent males, for example, are significantly less frequent in deprived municipalities. But the motorised two-wheeler riders as well as car passengers from deprived municipalities are characterized by an excess injury risk, whether the selected denominator is the number of users or the kilometres travelled by this mode. For the first time in France, this study has enabled a comparison of the effects of a contextual socioeconomic indicator (the type of municipality of residence, deprived, or not) on daily travel practices and injury incidences among the population, among the users of each mode and per km of travel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 max) in the trained state remained at ∼6 l/min, lean body weight remained at ∼70 kg, and maximal heart rate declined from 207 to 200 beats/min. Blood lactate threshold was typical of competitive cyclists in that it occurred at 76-85% V̇O2 max, yet maximal blood lactate concentration was remarkably low in the trained state. It appears that an 8% improvement in muscular efficiency and thus power production when cycling at a given oxygen uptake (V̇O2) is the characteristic that improved most as this athlete matured from ages 21 to 28 yr. It is noteworthy that at age 25 yr, this champion developed advanced cancer, requiring surgeries and chemotherapy. During the months leading up to each of his Tour de France victories, he reduced body weight and body fat by 4-7 kg (i.e., ∼7%). Therefore, over the 7-yr period, an improvement in muscular efficiency and reduced body fat contributed equally to a remarkable 18% improvement in his steady-state power per kilogram body weight when cycling at a given V̇O 2 (e.g., 5 l/min). It is hypothesized that the improved muscular efficiency probably reflects changes in muscle myosin type stimulated from years of training intensely for 3-6 h on most days.

In these scenarios, riders can choose to share the workload with other riders (cooperate) or pursue their own self-interests (defect). We compare the model's predictions to race situations and use it to investigate how different strategies can affect outcomes. We find that an individual player's best strategy depends on fitness level: below-average riders fare better as defectors whereas above-average riders perform better as cooperators. The strategies of stronger riders affect their teammates' results as well. The teammates of defecting strong riders fare worse overall than the teammates of cooperating strong riders. These results reproduce a dynamic that played out in the 2009 Tour de France. The winner, Alberto Contador, pursued a strategy perceived by many to be unusually uncooperative by repeatedly defecting on his teammates. The strategy worked to his advantage but may have negatively affected his teammates' placements. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Agent-based model; Agent-based simulation; Bike racing; Cooperation","","","","","","","","Olds T., The mathematics of breaking away and chasing in cycling, Eur J Appl Physiol, 77, pp. 492-497, (1998); Kyle C.R., Reduction of wind resistance and power output of racing cyclists and runners traveling in groups, Ergonomics, 22, pp. 387-397, (1979); Broker J.P., Kyle C.R., Burke E.R., Racing cyclist power requirements in the 4000-m individual and team pursuits, Med Sci Sports Exer, 34, pp. 1677-1685, (1999); Olds T., Norton K., Craig N., Modeling road-cycling performance, J Appl Physiol, 78, pp. 1596-1611, (1995); Ronfeldt D., Social Science at 190 mph on NASCAR's biggest superspeedways, First Monday, 5, pp. 1-29, (2000); Nowak M.A., May R.M., Evolutionary games and spatial chaos, Nature, 359, pp. 826-829, (1992); Santos F.C., Pacheco J.M., Lenaerts T., Evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas in structured heterogeneous populations, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 3490-3494, (2006); Perc M., Szolnoki A., Social diversity and promotion of cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma game, Phys Rev E, 77, (2008); Szilagyi M.N., Simulation of multiagent Prisoners' Dilemmas, Syst Anal Model Simul, 43, pp. 829-846, (2003); Power C., A spatial agent-based model of n-person Prisoner's Dilemma cooperation in a socio-geographic community, J Artif Soc Soc Simul, 12, (2009); Benenson J.F., Markovits H., Thompson M.E., Wrangham R.W., Strength determines coalitional strategies in humans, Proc R Soc B, 276, pp. 2589-2595, (2009); Vinacke W.E., Intra-group power relations, strategy, and decisions in inter-triad competition, Sociometry, 27, pp. 25-39, (1964); Axtell R.L., Non-cooperative dynamics of multi-agent teams, AAMAS '02: Proceedings of the First International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pp. 1082-1089, (2002); Paris C.R., Salas E., Teamwork in multi-person systems: A review and analysis, Ergonomics, 43, pp. 1052-1075, (2000); Yilmaz L., Philips J., Team-RUP: Agent-based simulation of team behavior in software development organizations, Int J Simula Process Model, 3, pp. 170-179, (2007); Jin Y., Levitt R.E., The virtual design team: A computational model of project organizations, Comput Math Organ Theory, 2, pp. 171-196, (1996); Albert E., Riding a line: Competition and cooperation in the sport of bicycle racing, Sociol Sport J, 8, pp. 341-361, (1991); Juttel A., Olympic road cycling and national identity: Where is Germany?, J Sport Soc Issues, 26, pp. 195-208, (2002); Wooldridge M., An Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems, (2002); Vogt S., Heinrich L., Schumacher Y.O., Blum A., Roecker K., Dickhuth H., Schmid A., Power output during stage racing in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 38, pp. 147-151, (2006)","R.

It has had a profound effect on daily mobilities as well as new construction and a reorganization of functional space in France. New TGV stations are located sometimes at very variable distances from original stations and downtowns. Logics of speed - those of the SNCF train company - tend of eliminate intermediary stops, but local planning and lobbying efforts aim at ensuring that cities are adequately served by high-speed trains. Regional governments in charge of local intercity rail service are implementing hub rail operations at regional stations. Local efforts aim to use TGV stations for urban redevelopment by creating intermodal nodes linking rail service and city transportation, thru emphasis on ""green"" urban transport policies (light-rail systems, bike-rental schemes). Stations are major urban nodes once again. This French experience can be studied for the development of high-speed rail networks in Asia and North America.","","Intermodal transportation; Railroads; Urban transportation; Functional spaces; High speed trains; High-speed rail lines; New constructions; Regional government; Urban redevelopment; Urban transport policies; Variable distances; Railroad transportation","","","","","","","Auphan E., Le TGV Méditeranée : Un pas décisif dans l'évolution du modèle français à grande vitesse, Méditerranée, 98, pp. 19-26, (2002); Auphan E., Un quart de siècle de grande vitesse ferroviaire en France, Bulletin de L'Association de Géographes Français, 85, pp. 431-442, (2008); Barre A., Menerault P., L'interconnexion Train/VAL Dans L'agglomération Lilloise, pp. 106-111, (2001); Bavoux J.J., La Bourgogne: Un archétype d'espace intermédiaire?, Annales de Géographie, 570, pp. 162-174, (1993); Beyer A., La capacité d'articulation des territoires, enjeu majeur de la grande vitesse européenne, Bulletin de L'Association de Géographes Français, 85, pp. 427-430, (2008); Bozzani S., L'intermodalité air-fer à grande vitesse au service du rayonnement métropolitain, Cahiers Scientifiques Du Transport, 47, pp. 61-88, (2005); Derycke P.-H., Offner J.-M., Réseaux et équité territoriale, Flux, 13, pp. 5-7, (1994); Facchinetti-Mannone V., La nodalité des gares TGV périphériques, Cahiers Scientifiques Du Transport, 48, pp. 45-58, (2005); Mannone V., Gares TGV et nouvelles dynamiques urbaines en centre ville: Le cas des villes desservies par le TGV Sud-Est, Cahiers Scientifiques Du Transport, 31, pp. 71-97, (1997); Menerault P., Dynamiques et Politiques Régionales Autour Du Tunnel Sous la Manche et Du TGV Nord, Annales de Géographie, 593, pp. 5-33, (1997); Ollivro J., L'homme à Toutes Vitesses, de la Lenteur Homogène à la Rapidité Différenciée, (2000); Thompson I., High-speed transport hubs and eurocity status: The case of Lyon, Journal of Transport Geography, 3, pp. 29-37, (1995); Troin J.F., Les gares T.G.V.

From the 10 cyclists (30 ± 4 years, 178 ± 8 cm, 69 ± 6 kg) involved in the study, 108 ascents were recorded and analyzed using a mobile power measurement device (SRM Training Systems, Jülich, Germany). Based on topographic characteristics, the ascents were categorized into 1st and Hors Category (HC) climbs. During the ascents of the 1st Category climbs, power output averaged 312 ± 43 W (4.5 ± 0.6 W/kg) with a mean cadence of 73 ± 6 rpm and a mean duration of 37:41 ± 16:16 min. Power output averaged 294 ± 36 W (4.3 ± 0.6 W/kg) at a mean cadence of 70 ± 6 rpm during 57: 40 ± 10:32 min on HC climbs. The maximal mean power for long durations (1800 s) showed a mean power output of 327 W and 346 W for the 1st and HC climbs, respectively. The evaluation of the cadence-power output and the distance per pedaling cycle-power output relationship shows that high power outputs are mainly yielded by higher pedaling cadences and higher gears. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Grand Tours;

However, information on optimal muscle trauma management is scarce. The present study sought to assess the initial treatment of muscle injury in sportspeople, evaluate rehabilitation programs and observe the impact on healing. Methods: We included consecutive patients consulting for severe muscle pain with a physician at the Questel Sports Medicine Surgery in the city of Brest (western France). The study examined the circumstances of the injury, possible antecedents and the initial treatment (with the RICE protocol). After clinical and ultrasound examinations, each patient was referred to the physiotherapist of his/her choice with an identical recovery program (muscle strengthening exercises, cycling on an exercise bike and guidance on resuming sport). The patient was subsequently interviewed by phone at two time points: four months after the injury, to ascertain the date of resumption of gentle sporting activity (e.g., jogging) or return to the pre-injury sporting level (i.e., full recovery) and to establish whether the patient and the physiotherapist had respectively complied with the prescribed treatment and 15 months after the injury, to investigate any re-injury and/or any other muscle injuries. The patients were classified into two groups: those who were able to resume full sporting activity within 40 days (minor muscle injuries: Group 1) and those who were also able to resume full sporting activity but only after more than 40 days (major muscle injuries: Group 2). We, then, compared the two groups in order to identify factors potentially related to recovery. Results: Ninety-five cases were included in the study; this corresponded to 93 patients, two of whom had two different injuries each. The RICE protocol: sport was immediately discontinued in 90 cases and shortly afterwards in five cases. Ice was applied in 57 cases (60%) and compression was applied in 17 cases (17.8%). There were 34 patients (35.8%) in Group 1, with an average return to gentle sporting activity (jogging) on day 11 post-injury and full resumption of their sport on day 23. There were 61 cases (64.2%) in Group 2, with an average return to jogging on day 39 and full resumption of their sport on day 69. Compliance with the prescription: rehabilitation was performed in only 62 cases (64.5%), with no major difference between the two groups. In terms of the physiotherapist's compliance with the prescription, 40 of the 62 patients did some weight training, 29 performed cycling and 58 were given advice on the resumption of sporting activity. Resumption of sport: in both groups, the duration of incapacity did not depend on whether rehabilitation had been performed or not. The second phone interview yielded a total of 84 replies (88%): seven patients (8%) had suffered re-injury in the same muscle group (no difference between Groups 1 and 2) and 22 patients (26%) had incurred injuries in another muscle group. Conclusion: The RICE protocol might give better results if compression were to be used more extensively. In terms of rehabilitation, therapeutic compliance is rather weak and physiotherapists do not fully comply with physician's prescription. However, for both minor and major injuries, rehabilitation (to the extent that it was implemented by the physiotherapists in the present study) did not lead to quicker recovery. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The allocation of space, speed limits for vehicles and user priority rules are also elements that influence the comfort and safety of pedestrian and cyclist circulation and, in turn, the choice of travel mode. Several road-sharing concepts developed in other countries are of great interest; the ""code de la rue"" (street use code) in France provides an excellent example. This approach, which was launched in 2006, has led to substantial advances, both in terms of regulations and urban street planning. Cities now have at their disposal a range of concepts that are adapted to different categories of urban roads, characterized by speed management associated with a specific way of sharing the public space. In a context where we seek to promote sustainable mobility and to review how the road is shared, this makes for a very interesting example. These objectives are at the heart of debates in Québec. The proliferation of initiatives, the wide variety of stakeholders involved and the mechanisms of consultation set in place are very important success factors in overcoming major challenges that transportation and road safety present in urban areas.","","Pedestrian safety; Transportation; Urban planning; Speed management; Street design; Success factors; Sustainable mobility; Travel behaviour; Travel modes; Urban streets; User priorities; Roads and streets","","","","","","","Ashton S.J., Pedestrian injuries: The influence of vehicle design, Road Safety Research and Practice, (1981); Zones, 30, (2008); Quartiers Verts, Actifs et en Santé; The ""code de la Rue"" (Street Use Code) Programme in France.

We only reconnoitre once around, amid infinite possibilities, choosing, discarding, bypassing, an art of synecdoche, decreeing that such an itinerary or inventory is but part of a greater whole, a sub-product, an evanescence. The once-around tour involves a narrative poetics, as witness the Tour de France cyclist - on the heels of other famous ""Tours de France"" (monarchies and governments, of Flora Tristan's ""two children,"" the early sociologist investigators). From the start in 1903 to the present day, the ""Grande Boucle"" (""Great Loop"") reporters constantly sought better ways to report the dramatic cyclist event. Looking at the corpus of texts by the two most illustrious Tour commentators, its founder Henri Desgrange, and Albert Londres, this study reveals the rhetorical, narrative, intertextual and interdiscursive resources mobilized by the ""récit de l'étape"" (""stage report""), then shows how this account would be unreadable outside a specific social imaginary.","","","","","","","","","Gaboriau P., Le Tour de France et le Vélo.

In France, as in many developed countries, the reporting of fatalities is almost complete but the reporting of non-fatal casualties is rather low. It is moreover strongly biased. Valid estimates are needed. Methods: Using the capture-recapture method on police data and on a road trauma registry covering a large county of 1.6 million inhabitants, we estimate police under-reporting correction factors that account for unregistered casualties. These correction factors are then applied to the nation-wide police data, with standardization on under-reporting bias factors. Results: In 2004, whereas the police report 108 727 non-fatally injured, the estimation yields 400 200. Over the 1996-2004 study period, the average annual estimated incidence is 871/100 000 for all injured (3.4 times the police incidence), 232/100 000 for hospitalized, 103/100 000 for seriously injured (2.2 times the police incidence) and 12.6/100 000 for casualties with long-term major impairment. The incidence of seriously injured (NISS 9+) is 11.3/100 000 for pedestrians, 9.5/100 000 for cyclists, 36.3/100 000 for motorized two-wheel users and 42.5/100 000 for car users. Conclusions: The estimated incidences are much higher than the police-based ones. This changes the scale of the road injuries issue. The risk of suffering a major impairment from a road crash is equal to the risk of being killed. Motorized two-wheel users experience a large burden of traffic casualties, much larger than that indicated by police data. The approach used can be reproduced in other countries, if an additional medical registration exists. © The Author 2008.

Lance underwent four cycles of chemotherapy, actually the pretty standard one, pioneered at the Indiana University and not only did he get completely cured of his cancer, he remains extremely well till date, 12 years later. He sure did have a few adverse effects during those cycles of chemotherapy in the form of nausea, vomiting, weakness and fall in blood count but he knew and experienced them only for a short transient time and emerged triumphant and strong. In fact, he went on to win six awe-inspiring and incredible successive Tours de France victories from 1999-2005, one of the most grueling sporting events testing the endurance of the very fittest. After his retirement, he has been so inspired that he has completely devoted himself to educate people about the common myths about cancer, and promised to raise awareness and generate money for furthering research into surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy for cancer through his foundation. He says ""I am indebted to the doctors, nurses and medicine and would want to pay them back for all their energy and caring."" In his successful journey of overcoming cancer, he captures the essence of its treatment so well by declaring ""Pain is temporary, it may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually, it will subside and something else will take its place.

Our study reveals that, between 2000 and 2007, the subway's (Métro) share in total inner-Paris travel increased by 13.6%, the RER's share by 10.3% and the SNCF's share by 20.5%. These three means of transport account for 58% of daily travel. On the other hand, the bus share has decreased by 16% and that of cars by 23.7%. Private motor vehicles represent 37.3% of total travel. Looking at road traffic, where public transport (buses) and private motor transport compete for the use of limited road space, private motor vehicles account for 91.5% and public transport 8.5% of total travel.The 2WMV share in Paris traffic increased by 36% between 2000 and 2007, with 2WMVs now accounting for a share twice as large as that of buses. A survey has shown that 100 million additional passenger kilometres were made by 2WMV in 2007 compared to 2000. 53% of this increase comes from people shifting to 2WMV from public transport and 26.5% from private cars. The remaining 20% is attributable to the increased use of 2WMVs by those already owning such vehicles in 2000.Is the growth in the share of 2WMV traffic in Paris beneficial to the community? This shift in the means of transport generates time savings of €293 million and increases owners' vehicle usage costs by €49 million. The cost of accidents is increased by €49 million and the negative consequences in terms of pollution are estimated at €22.6 million. The welfare impact of the government revenue change is negative and equal to €4.7 million. In total, the gain for the community is therefore around €168 million. Accident costs are the key issue. The fact that there are on average 21 2WMV fatalities in Paris (average 2006-2007) for a means of transport accounting for 16% of passenger/km made every day in Paris offers a striking contrast to the 6 (average 2006-2007) fatalities concerning cyclists which account for a mere 0.1% of trips. The massive shift to 2WMV has taken place without any public policy support. Public policy could easily further improve the 2WMV cost-benefit balance by taking measures that would decrease the number of accidents. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost benefit analysis; Modal shift; Two-wheel motor vehicle","France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; accident; automobile; cost-benefit analysis; public transport; road transport; transportation mode; transportation planning; transportation policy; travel behavior; welfare economics","","","","","Association of European Motorcycle Manufacturers","The author of this study would like to thank Jean-Pierre Orfeuil and Rémy Prud'homme who agreed to read the draught versions and suggested modifications.

To accomplish this, we compared the frequencies of the ACE and CKMM genotypes/alleles in 50 top-level Spanish professional cyclists that have completed at least one of these events to 119 sedentary controls, and 27 elite (Olympic-class) Spanish runners. The genetic polymorphism at the CK-MM locus was detected with the NcoI restriction endonuclease. The results of our study showed that the proportion of the DD genotype was higher in cyclists (50.0%) than in the other two groups (p<0.05), the proportion of the ID genotype was higher in controls (46.2%) than in the other two groups (p<0.05), and the proportion of the II genotype was higher in runners (40.7%) than in the other two groups (p<0.05). The proportion of the D allele was higher in both cyclists (65.0%) and controls (57.6%) than in runners (46.3%) (p<0.001), whereas the proportion of the I allele was higher in runners than in the other two groups (p<0.001). No statistical differences were found for CKK-MM-NcoI. We conclude that in top-level professional cyclists capable of completing a classic 3-wk tour race, the frequency distribution of the D allele and the DD genotype seems to be higher than in other endurance athletes such as elite runners (in whom the I allele is especially frequent). © Georg Thieme Verlag KG.","Allele; Endurance; Genotype; Sports","Adult; Bicycling; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Humans; Male; Physical Endurance; Polymorphism, Genetic; Reference Values; Renin; Running; Task Performance and Analysis; creatine kinase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; restriction endonuclease; adult; article; athlete; controlled study; cycling; endurance; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic analysis; genetic polymorphism; genotype; human; male; restriction mapping; running; sport; task performance","","creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; Renin, EC 3.4.23.15","","","","","Alvarez R., Terrados N., Ortolano R., Iglesias-Cubero G., Reguero J.R., Batalla A., Cortina A., Fernandez-Garcia B., Rodriguez C., Braga S., Alvarez V., Goto E., Genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin system and athletic performance, Eur J Appl Physiol, 82, pp. 117-120, (2000); Bassett D.R., Howley E.T., Limiting factors for maximum oxygen uptake and determinants of endurance performance, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 70-84, (2000); Coetzer P., Noakes T.D., Sanders B., Lambert M.I., Bosch A.N., Wiggins T., Dennis S.C., Superior resistance of elite black South African distance runners, J Appl Physiol, 75, pp. 1822-1827, (1993); Coyle E.F., Sidossis L.F., Horowitz J.F., Beltz J.D., Cycling efficiency is related to the percentage of Type I muscle fibers, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 24, pp. 782-788, (1992); Echegaray M., Rivera M.A., Role of creatine kinase isoenzymes on muscular and cardiorespiratory endurance.

About 23 per cent of the metabolic energy is used for muscle work, the rest is converted to heat. We calculated heat transfer by conduction and blood flow inside the body, and heat transfer from the skin by radiation, convection and sweat evaporation, resulting in temperature changes in 25 body compartments. We simulated a mountain time trial to Alpe d'Huez during the Tour de France. To approach the time realized by Lance Armstrong in 2004, very high oxygen uptake must be sustained by the simulated cyclist. Temperature was predicted to reach 39°C in the brain, and 39.7°C in leg muscle. In addition to the macroscopic simulation, we analysed the buffering of bursts of high adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by creatine kinase during cyclical muscle activity at the biochemical pathway level. To investigate the low oxygen to carbohydrate ratio for the brain, which takes up lactate during exercise, we calculated the flux distribution in cerebral energy metabolism. Computational modelling of the human body, describing heat exchange and energy metabolism, makes simulation of endurance sports events feasible.

I use event study techniques to analyse the impact of Landis's rise and fall on the profitability of Phonak, his team's sponsor. I find that neither his spectacular win nor his rapid fall had an immediate impact on Phonak but that there was a significant cumulative abnormal return to Phonak stock in the wake of these events.

We report here the typical variation in competition times of elite cyclists in various race series. Repeated-measures analysis of log-transformed official race times provided the typical variation in a cyclist's performance as a coefficient of variation. The typical variation of a top cyclist (and its 95% likely limits) was 0.4% (0.3-0.5%) in World Cup road races, 0.7% (0.7-0.8%) in Tour de France road races, 1.2% (0.8-2.2%) in the Kilo, 1.3% (0.9-2.4%) in road time trials, 1.7% (1.2-2.6%) in Tour de France time trials, and 2.4% (2.1-2.8%) in World Cup mountain biking. Cyclist interdependence arising from team tactics and pack riding probably accounts for the lower variability in performance of cyclists in road races and precludes estimation of the smallest worthwhile change in performance time for cyclists in these events. The substantial differences in variability between the remaining events, where riders act independently of each other, arise from various event-specific aspects. For these events the smallest worthwhile changes in performance time (∼ 0.5 × typical variation) are ∼ 0.5% in the Kilo, ∼ 0.6% in road time trials, and ∼ 1.2% in mountain-bike races.","Competition; Error; Reliability; Testing and evaluation","","","","","","","","Hopkins W.G., Measures of reliability in sports medicine and science, Sports Med, 30, pp. 1-15, (2000); Hopkins W.G., Hawley J.A., Burke L.M., Design and analysis of research on sport performance enhancement, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 31, pp. 472-485, (1999); Hopkins W.G., Hewson D.J., Variability of competitive performance of distance runners, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 33, pp. 1588-1592, (2001); Paton C.D., Hopkins W.G., Tests of cycling performance, Sports Med, 31, pp. 489-496, (2001); Stewart A.M., Hopkins W.G., Consistency of swimming performance within and between competitions, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 997-1001, (2000)","","","","","","","","","15367290","","","","English","Eur.

Surprisingly, performance enhancement by epo and blood doping is not that clear-cut for endurance athletes, leading to the question whether doping indeed strongly influenced cyclists’ performances from the 1990s onwards. We examined the records (1947–2008) of the Tour de France, Giro d’Italia, and Vuelta a España (N = 181) and assessed the time it took riders to win the race. The findings revealed normally distributed performances and linear and quartic relationships in victors’ performances over time that correspond with Brewer’s (2002) sociohistorical analysis of professional cycling, suggesting that effects of the epo epidemic on professional cyclists’ achievements may be overestimated. © 2011 by the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance.","Doping; Historical records of European cycling; Sport performance; Stage races","Analysis of Variance; Athletic Performance; Bicycling; Doping in Sports; Erythropoietin; Humans; Male; Physical Endurance; erythropoietin; analysis of variance; article; athletic performance; bicycle; doping; drug effect; endurance; human; male; physiology","","erythropoietin, 11096-26-7; Erythropoietin, 11096-26-7","","","","","Albergotti R., O'Connell V., Blood brothers, The Wall Street Journal, pp. 15-17, (2010); Audran M., Gareau R., Matecki S., Durand F., Chenard C., Sicart M.-T., Bressole F., Effects of erythropoietin administration in training athletes and possible indirect detection in doping control, Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, 31, pp. 639-645, (1999); Birkeland K.I., Stray-Gundersen J., Hemmersbach P., Hallen J., Haug E., Bahr R., Effect of rhEPO administration on serum levels in sTfR and cycling performance, Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, 32, pp. 1238-1243, (2000); Brewer B.F., Commercialization in professional cycling 1950–2001: Institutional transformations and the rationalization of “doping”, Sociology of Sport Journal, 19, pp. 276-301, (2002); Brouwer B., Lodewijkx H.F.M., Kuipers H., Doping confessions of cyclists revisited.

The severe TBI was defined as an injury to the brain or the skull, excluding scalp injuries, with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) severity score greater than 2. The severe TBI of 1238 patients were described. The annual incidence and mortality of severe TBI were, respectively, 13.7 per 100,000 and 5.3 per 100,000. The fatality rate increased from 20% in childhood to 71% over 75-year-old. Compared to restrained car occupants, the odds ratio for having a severe TBI was 18.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 12.8-25.5) for un-helmeted motorcyclists, 9.2 (95% CI = 7.5-11.3) for pedestrians, 6.4 (95% CI = 4.7-8.8) for un-helmeted cyclists, 3.9 (95% CI = 3.1-4.8) for unrestrained car occupants and 2.8 (95% CI = 2.2-3.5) for helmeted motorcyclists. Even after adjustment for several severity factors, male gender and age above 55 were both risk factors. Prevention programs aiming at improving the head protection should be promoted. The circumstances of the accident should be taken into account to predict a severe TBI. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods In France, the Rhône county (1.6 million inhabitants) is covered by a road trauma registry that includes emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and fatalities. Over the 1998e2008 period, 13 797 cyclist casualties were identified. The injuries sustained were coded using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for injuries to the head (AIS1+ and AIS3+), face (AIS1+), or neck (AIS1+). The study uses a caseecontrol design where the control group includes cyclists injured below the neckdthat is, not injured in the region associated with the helmet. We first adjusted for age, gender, and type of crash, as in a previously published Cochrane review. Then we adjusted for injury severity based on non-head, face, or neck injury, and when relevant, for crash location: type of road, urban/ rural area. Results The fully adjusted ORs of helmeted versus unhelmeted cyclists are: for AIS1+ head injuries, 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.81); for AIS3+ head injuries sustained in urban areas, 0.34 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.65), those sustained in rural areas, 0.07 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.23); for AIS1+ facial injuries, 0.72 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.83); and for AIS1+ neck injuries, 1.18 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.47). Conclusion This study confirms the protective effect for head and facial injuries, even though soft-shell helmets have now become more common. The reduction of risk is greater for serious head injuries. The study is inconclusive about the risk for neck injuries.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bicycling; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Craniocerebral Trauma; Facial Injuries; France; Head Protective Devices; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neck Injuries; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Urban Population; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; bicycle; case control study; child; face injury; France; head injury; helmet; human; incidence; injury; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; neck injury; preschool child; review; risk; risk factor; rural population; statistics; urban population","","","","","","","Constant A., Lagarde E., Protecting vulnerable road users from injury, PLoS Med, 7, (2010); Amoros E., Martin J.L., Lafont S., Et al., Actual incidences of road casualties, and their injury severity, modelled from police and hospital data, France, Eur J Public Health, 18, pp. 360-365, (2008); Papon F., de Solere R., Les modes actifs: Marche et vélo de retour en ville, La revue, Commissariat général au développement durable-Service de l'observation et des statistiques, (2010); Amoros E., Chiron M., Laumon B., Injury epidemiology of cyclists, based on a large road trauma registry; Attewell R., Glase K., McFadden M., Bicycle helmet efficacy: A meta-analysis, Accid Anal Prev, 33, pp. 345-352, (2001); Lastennet F., Sizun J., Dobrzynski M., Et al., Interet du casque cycliste chez l'enfant: Analyse qualitative de la litterature (In French), Arch Pediatr, 8, pp. 1246-1250, (2001); Thompson D., Rivara F., Thompson R., Helmets for preventing head and facial injuries in bicyclists, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 4, (1999); Maimaris C., Summer C., Browning C., Et al., Injury patterns in cyclists attending an accident and emergency department: A comparison of helmet wearers and non-wearers, BMJ, 308, pp. 1537-1540, (1994); Thomas S., Acton C., Nixon J., Et al., Effectiveness of bicycle helmets in preventing head injury in children: Caseecontrol study, BMJ, 308, pp. 173-176, (1994); McDermott F.T., Lane J.C., Brazenor G.A., Et al., The effectiveness of bicycle helmets: A study of 1710 casualties, J Trauma, 34, pp. 834-845, (1993); Thompson D.C., Rivara F.P., Thompson R.S., Effectiveness of bicycle safety helmets in preventing head injuries, JAMA, 276, pp. 1968-1973, (1996); Hansen K.S., Engesaeter L.B., Viste A., Protective effect of different types of bicycle helmets, Traffic Inj Prev, 4, pp. 285-290, (2003); Thompson D.C., Nunn M.E., Thompson R.S., Effectiveness of bicycle safety helmets in preventing serious facial injuries, JAMA, 276, pp. 1974-1975, (1996); Wasserman R.C., Buccini R.V., Helmet protection from head injuries among recreational bicyclists, Am J Sports Med, 19, pp. 96-97, (1990); Rivara F.P., Thompson D.C., Thompson R.S., Epidemiology of bicycle injuries and risk factors for serious injury, Inj Prev, 3, pp. 110-114, (1997); Laumon B., Martin J.L., Collet P., Et al., A French road accident trauma registry: First results, 41st annual conference of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medecine, (1997); Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, The Abbreviated Injury Scale (1990 revision), (1990); Robertson L.S., Injury Epidemiology, (1992); Marshall S.W., Injury caseecontrol studies using ""other injuries"" as controls, Epidemiology, 19, pp. 277-279, (2008); Mueller B.A., Cummings P., Rivara F.P., Et al., Injuries of the head, face, and neck in relation to ski helmet use, Epidemiology, 19, pp. 270-276, (2008); Cummings P., Rivara F.P., Thompson D.C., Et al., Misconceptions regarding caseecontrol studies of bicycle helmets and head injury, Accid Anal Prev, 38, pp. 636-643, (2006); Allison P., Missing Data.

Blood was analyzed for hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) and %reticulocytes. Seventy-six percent of all samples were collected out-of-competition (OOC). From December 2006 to September 2007, the average Hct and [Hb] decreased by 4.3 percent point and 1.3 g/dL, respectively. After the end of the competitive season, the values increased back to baseline levels. During the Tour de France, the [Hb] decreased by 11.5%, with individual decreases ranging from 7.0 to 20.6%. Hct and [Hb] values were lower in-competition (40.9% and 14.1 g/dL) compared to OOC (43.2% and 15.0 g/dL) and pre-competition (43.5% and 14.9 g/dL). Our results suggest that when interpreting blood sample results in an anti-doping context, the sample timing (OOC, pre- or in-competition) and time of year should be kept in mind. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Biological passport; Blood manipulations; Blood profiles; Elite athletes","Adult; Bicycling; Competitive Behavior; Doping in Sports; Exercise Test; Exercise Tolerance; Hematocrit; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; Reticulocytes; Young Adult; hemoglobin; hemoglobin; adult; article; athlete; cycling; doping; false positive result; hematocrit; hemoglobin blood level; human; male; normal human; reticulocyte count; variance; bicycle; competitive behavior; doping; exercise test; exercise tolerance; physiology; reticulocyte","","hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; Hemoglobins, ","","","","","Ashenden M.J., Sharpe K., Damsgaard R., Jarvis L., Standardization of reticulocyte values in an antidoping context, American Journal of Clinical Pathology, 121, 6, pp. 816-825, (2004); Audran M., Gareau R., Matecki S., Durand F., Chenard C., Sicart M.-T., Marion B., Bressolle F., Effects of erythropoietin administration in training athletes and possible indirect detection in doping control, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 31, 5, pp. 639-645, (1999); Brugnara C., Use of reticulocyte cellular indices in the diagnosis and treatment of hematological disorders, International Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Research, 28, 1, pp. 1-11, (1998); Damsgaard R., Munch T., Morkeberg J., Mortensen S.P., Gonzalez-Alonso J., Effects of blood withdrawal and reinfusion on biomarkers of erythropoiesis in humans: Implications for anti-doping strategies, Haematologica, 91, 7, pp. 1006-1008, (2006); Gore C.J., Parisotto R., Ashenden M.J., Stray-Gundersen J., Sharpe K., Hopkins W., Emslie K.R., Howe C., Trout G.J., Kazlauskas R., Hahn A.G., Second-generation blood tests to detect erythropoietin abuse by athletes, Haematologica, 88, 3, pp. 333-344, (2003); Kalache G.R., Sartor M.M., Hughes W.G., The indirect estimation of hemoglobin concentration in whole blood, Pathology, 23, pp. 115-117, (1991); Kanstrup I.L., Ekblom B., Blood volume and hemoglobin concentration as determinants of maximal aerobic power, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 16, 3, pp. 256-262, (1984); Kayser B., Mauron A., Miah A., Current anti-doping policy: A critical appraisal, BMC Medical Ethics, 8, (2007); Lippi G., Banfi G., Franchini M., Guidi G.C., New strategies for doping control, J Sports Sci, 26, pp. 441-445, (2008); Lippi G., Franchini M., Guidi G., Haematocrit measurement and antidoping policies, Clin Lab Haematol, 24, pp. 65-66, (2002); Lippi G., Franchini M., Guidi G.C., Tour de chaos, Br J Sports Med, 41, pp. 625-626, (2007); Lippi G., Salvagno G.L., Solero G.P., Franchini M., Guidi G.C., Stability of blood cell counts, hematologic parameters and reticulocytes indexes on the Advia A120 hematologic analyzer, Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, 146, 6, pp. 333-340, (2005); Malcovati L., Pascutto C., Cazzola M., Hematologic passport for athletes competing in endurance sports: A feasibility study, Haematologica, 88, 5, pp. 570-581, (2003); Morkeberg J., Belhage B., Saltin B., Damsgaard R., Blood profiles in elite cross-country skiers: A 6-year follow-up, Scand J Med Sci Sports, (2008); Parisotto R., Ashenden M.J., Gore C.J., Sharpe K., Hopkins W., Hahn A.G., The effect of common hematologic abnormalities on the ability of blood models to detect erythropoietin abuse by athletes, Haematologica, 88, 8, pp. 931-940, (2003); Parisotto R., Gore C.J., Emslie K.R., Ashenden M.J., Brugnara C., Howe C., Martin D.T., Trout G.J., Hahn A.G., A novel method utilizing markers of altered erythropoiesis for the detection of recombinant human erythropoietin abuse in athletes, Haematologica, 85, 6, pp. 564-572, (2000); Robinson N., Schattenberg L., Zorzoli M., Mangin P., Saugy M., Haematological analysis conducted at the departure of the Tour de France 2001, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 26, 3, pp. 200-207, (2005); Saris W.H., Senden J.M., Brouns F., What is a normal red-blood cell mass for professional cyclists?, Lancet, 352, (1998); Sawka M.N., Convertino V.A., Eichner E.R., Schnieder S.M., Young A.J., Blood volume: Importance and adaptations to exercise training, environmental stresses, and trauma/sickness, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 332-348, (2000); Schumacher Y.O., Grathwohl D., Barturen J.M., Wollenweber M., Heinrich L., Schmid A., Huber G., Keul J., Haemoglobin, haematocrit and red blood cell indices in elite cyclists.

Approach – The chapter customises the Van de Velde typology for describing public and private interventions in public bicycle scheme implementation processes. The chapter considers schemes worldwide, but has a particular focus on France and Spain where these schemes are considered as a public service. Findings – The authors draw several conclusions on how to optimise public and private involvement in order to achieve the desired impacts. First, public bicycle schemes have to be integrated within cycling and urban mobility policies. Second, local governments have to ensure that contracts with private sector operators make maximum use of the operator’s skill, and by so doing will meet multi-modal travel behaviour objectives. Research limitations/implication – The chapter highlights the need of further research into organisational and contractual performance, the special economic features of industries based on the supply of a service through a network, and cost–benefit analysis. Practical implications – Public decision makers benefit from experience which is able to be assimilated and transmitted through international projects undertaken by international experts in the field. Social implications – Public bicycle schemes enable relatively easy and cheap access to sustainable modes of transport, and they contribute to an overall transport system with cycling as a prime means of movement, and towards cities which are more pleasant to live in. Originality – By integrating the main relevant data and publications into this worldwide overview, the chapter forms an essential starting point for future work relating to public bicycle schemes. © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Bike sharing; Cycling policy; Indicators; Models of governance; Public bicycles; Stakeholders","","","","","","","","Estudi d’habits De Mobilitat Dels Usuaris Del Bicing, (2007); Anaya E., Castro A., Balance General De La Bicicleta Pblica En España 2011, (2012); Clarification Des Competences Dans Le Champ Des Transports Et De La Gestion Des mobilitès, (2010); Bea M., Anaya E., Cost benefit evaluation of bicing, Paper Presented at ECOMM, (2009); Bergua E., Benaito J., Las vìas Ciclistas En El Estado español, (1997); Beroud B., Vèlo’v: Un Service De mobilitè De Personnes à transfèrer?

This policy may be explained in a great part by the success of the Velo'v in Lyon, which contributed to improve the image of cycling in the city. If bicycles, however, appear to find a new place in the city, one can wonder whether this is really due to bike sharing systems? What are the real uses of bicycles in contemporary cities, with or without such a system? To answer these questions, the paper starts with a literature review on bicycle in the city, to draw lessons from recent experiences of bike sharing systems. It then discusses the two cases of Lyon and Lille, which never had a bike sharing system on its own. The evolution of bicycle use is measured with a comparison of household transportation surveys in Lyon (1995 and 1998) and Lille (1998 and 2006). In both cities, the analysis reveals a rise in the proportion of healthiest citizens among urban bikers, as well as a return of bikes in dense areas. Bike sharing systems are part of such tendencies. They support them, but should not become a panacea for policies supporting bike use in the city. © 2012 INRETS et Springer-Verlag France.","Bike sharing system; Household surveys; Individual behaviours; Lille; Lyon","Sporting goods; Surveys; Image enhancement; Sporting goods; Surveys; Household surveys; Individual behaviour; Lille; Lyon; Sharing systems; Bike sharing system; European cities; Household surveys; Individual behavior; Lille; Literature reviews; Lya; Sharing systems; Transportation surveys; Bicycles; Bicycles","","","","","","","Carre J.R., La bicyclette, un mode de déplacement méconnu dans ses risques comme dans ses usages, Rech Transp Secur, 49, pp. 19-34, (1995); Ampt L., Rose G., Non-motorised transport: the forgotten modes?, Proceedings 17th ARRB conference, (1994); Amar G., Pour une écologie urbaine des transports, Ann Rech Urbaine, 59-60, pp. 4-15, (1993); Ravalet E., Modes de vie et modes de ville, activités et déplacements quotidiens à Montréal et Lyon, Environnement Urbain, 1, (2007); Owens P.M., Neighbourhood form and pedestrian life: taking a closer look, Landsc Urban Plan, 26, pp. 115-135, (1993); Heran F., Paques A., Tostain P., Metzger E., Les enjeux et les impacts d'une politique de ville cyclable, (1996); Noel N., Lee-Gosselin M., Mieux comprendre la pratique de la bicyclette: enquête sur les déplacements et les activités des cyclistes de la région métropolitaine de Québec, Rech Transp Secur, 74, pp. 26-49, (2002); Rocci A., L'adoption d'un système de VLS par les usagers et ses effets sur la pratique du vélo, Colloque EJC-LPA, modes partagés et mobilité durable, (2009); Maizia M., Dubedat E., Analyse quantitative d'un service de vélos en libre-service: un système de transport à part entière, Flux, 1, pp. 73-77, (2008); Papon F., Mûrissement social et pratique de la bicyclette, Démographie Et Transport: Villes Du Nord Et Villes Du Sud, pp. 263-288, (2002); Stahel W., Giarini O., The Limits to Certainty: Facing Risks in the New Service Economy, (1989); Dossier d'évaluation sur les vélos en libreservice, Les comptes de transports en 2008, pp. 31-46, (2009); Bussiere Y., Collomb J.L., Ravalet E., Cycling in the City and Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The Case of Mexico, (2009); Bussiere Y., Bernard A., L'impact du vélo sur les gaz à effet de serre au Québec, Rapport de recherche pour Vélo-Québec Montréal, (2000); Kolmer T., Vélo'v, le mode de déplacement qui manquait dans la chaîne des transports publics urbains, Rapport de stage et mémoire de Master 1 d'urbanisme et aménagement, (2006); Papon F., Marche et vélo dans les enquêtes « Ménages », Ministère de l'Environnement, PREDIT, (1999)","E.

France's mountain ranges play an important part in the legend's built up. Steep slopes harden the competition and every racing cyclist needs to clear the obstacles if he hopes to win. As all modern heroes, cyclists wear trademarked shirts and national-coloured ones.

Resident populations, including short- or long-term visitors to enzootic regions, are at risk of infection and disease. For the past several decades, killed viral vaccines prepared in tissue culture or mouse brain have been used effectively to immunize travelers and residents of enzootic countries. Cost, efficacy and safety concerns led to the development of a live-attenuated virus vaccine (SA14-14-2) and more recently, to the licensure in the USA, Europe, Canada, and Australia of a purified inactivated, tissue culture-based Japanese encephalitis vaccine (IXIARO®, referred to as IC51; Intercell AG, Vienna, Austria). In addition, a live-attenuated yellow fever-Japanese encephalitis chimeric vaccine (IMOJEV™, referred to as Japanese encephalitis-CV; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) was recently licensed in Australia and is under review in Thailand. A broad portfolio of safe and effective Japanese encephalitis vaccines has become available to meet the needs of at-risk populations; when appropriately delivered, these new vaccines should greatly diminish the burden of disease. © 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd.","clinical features; epidemiology; flavivirus; Japanese encephalitis; vaccines","Animals; Brain; Cells, Cultured; Clinical Trials as Topic; Encephalitis Virus, Japanese; Encephalitis, Japanese; Humans; Japanese Encephalitis Vaccines; Mice; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, Combined; Vaccines, Inactivated; Yellow Fever Vaccine; alpha interferon; biken; hepatitis A vaccine; imojev; Japanese encephalitis vaccine; placebo; ribavirin; sa 14142; steroid; unclassified drug; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; clinical feature; clinical trial; dose response; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug fever; drug hypersensitivity; drug induced headache; drug safety; epidemic; gastrointestinal symptom; human; immunization; Japanese encephalitis; myalgia; nonhuman; priority journal; review","","ribavirin, 36791-04-5; Japanese Encephalitis Vaccines, ; Vaccines, Attenuated, ; Vaccines, Combined, ; Vaccines, Inactivated, ; Yellow Fever Vaccine, ","biken; havrix, Glaxo SmithKline Biologicals, Belgium; imojev, Sanofi Pasteur, France; ixiaro; jevax, Sanofi Pasteur, France; sa 14142","Glaxo SmithKline Biologicals, Belgium; Sanofi Pasteur, France; Sanofi Pasteur, France","","","Halstead S., Jacobson J., Japanese encephalitis vaccines, Vaccines, pp. 311-352, (2008); Erlanger T.E., Weiss S., Keiser J., Utzinger J., Wiedenmayer K., Past, present, and future of Japanese encephalitis, Emerg.

The growth in the use of powered two-wheelers in towns and the over-involvement of this category of users in injury accidents demonstrate the need for a better understanding of powered two-wheeler accident phenomena in order to develop countermeasures, notably through road engineering. This research uses an indepth, qualitative analysis of a representative sampling of 278 police reports on urban accidents involving at least one powered two-wheeler and the concentration of these accidents in prototypical accident scenarios. Twenty-five prototypical accident scenarios accounting for approximately 80% of the accidents in the sampling were drawn up and were used to demonstrate the influence of certain engineering choices in the production of accidents among this category of users. The principal prototypical scenarios are presented in detail in this article.

They were thus excluded from participation in the leisure activities reserved for the native French.

Ten trained male cyclists (mean±s: age 40±5 years, VO2max 56±4 ml · kg-1 · min-1) completed the 2007 Tour de France route. Before, during, and 2 days after the Tour, all participants underwent an echocardiographic examination to determine ejection fraction, as well as systolic (S'), early diastolic (E'), and late diastolic (A') myocardial tissue velocities, together with the E':A' ratio. Venous blood samples were collected and analysed for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and B-type-natriuretic peptide. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to investigate the cumulative effects of prolonged exercise bouts on LV function and cardiac biomarkers. Alpha was set at 0.05. Although both the ejection fraction (71 ± 2% vs. 59 ± 4%; P ± 0.05) and the E':A' ratio (1.60 ± 0.15 vs. 1.09 ± 0.12; P > 0.05) were reduced at post-stage assessments, there was limited evidence of a progressive decline in either variable over the 22 days. Although post-tour ejection fraction was not different to baseline (68 ± 3%; P ± 0.05), the E':A' ratio remained depressed (1.37 ± 0.26; P > 0.05) following 2 days of recovery. No cTnI was detectable at baseline and B-type-natriuretic peptide was within normal ranges (24 ± 7 pg · ml-1). Cardiac troponin I was detectable in at least one cyclist at every assessment, with 60% being positive after stage 15 (range 0.02-0.09 μg · ml-1). B-type-natriuretic peptide peaked following stage 17 (240 ± 145 pg · ml-1). In conclusion, repetitive endurance cycling resulted in an acute reduction in LV function and the sporadic appearance of cardiac biomarkers following each day of exercise. Despite this there was no cumulative effect of repetitive exercise. Minor changes in diastolic function persisted up to 48 h of recovery.","Cardiac troponin I; Diastolic and systolic function; Tissue-Doppler","","","","","","","","Bonetti A., Tirelli F., Albertini R., Monica C., Monica M., Tredici G., Serum cardiac troponin T after repeated endurance exercise events, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, pp. 259-262, (1996);

The usual approach considers a “cardinal” linear weighting of the different single-dimensional performance indicators. The authors present an alternative approach, which merely requires “ordinal” information regarding the importance of the different performance dimensions. It is argued that this approach is robust with respect to alternative specifications of the (possibly nonlinear) underlying performance aggregation function. An application to Tour de France racing cyclists (in the period 1953-2004) illustrates the approach. The authors find that Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and Lance Armstrong (robustly) dominate almost all other racing cyclists in the sample, although they do not dominate each other. A net-dominance metric ranks Bernard Hinault on the first place in the sample; Eddy Merckx and Lance Armstrong follow very closely ex-aequo on the second place. © 2006, Sage Publications.

METHODS: Eight men (age 25 +/- 5 y, body mass 71.4 +/- 7.4 kg, and height 177.4 +/- 4.5 cm) and 6 women (age 26 +/- 4 y, body mass 62.5 +/- 5.6 kg, and height 170.4 +/- 5.2 cm) of the Australian Institute of Sport Road Cycling squads participated in the study. The men competed in the 6-d Tour Down Under (Adelaide, Australia), and the women, in the 10-d Tour De L'Aude (Aude, France). Body mass was recorded before and immediately after the race. Cyclists recalled the number of water bottles and amount of food they had consumed. RESULTS: Men and women recorded body-mass losses of approximately 2 kg (2.8% body mass) and 1.5 kg (2.6% body mass), respectively, per stage during the long road races. Men had an average fluid intake of 1.0 L/h, whereas women only consumed on average 0.4 L/h. In addition, men consumed CHO at the rate suggested by dietitians (average CHO intake of 48 g/h), but again the women failed to reach recommendations, with an average intake of approximately 21 g/h during a road stage. CONCLUSIONS: Men appeared to drink and eat during racing in accordance with current nutritional recommendations, but women failed to reach these guidelines. Both men and women finished their races with a body-mass loss of approximately 2.6% to 2.8%. Further research is required to determine the impact of this loss on road-cycling performance and thermoregulation.","","Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Bicycling; Body Mass Index; Dehydration; Drinking; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Nutritional Status; adaptation; adult; analysis of variance; article; bicycle; body mass; comparative study; dehydration; drinking; eating; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; female; human; male; nutritional status; physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15550265","","","19255455","English","Int J Sports Physiol Perform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548446958"

The course is about 4000 km including 30 mountain passages (up to 2700 m altitude) and can be considered as one of the most strenuous endurance endeavors. Nutritional intake was calculated from daily food records. EE was estimated from sleeping time and the low activity period. EE during cycling was predicted based on detailed information. Mean energy intake (EI) was 24.7 MJ with a highest mean daily EI of 32.4 MJ. Mean EE was 25.4 MJ with a highest mean daily EE of 32.7 MJ. Relative contribution of protein, CHO, and fat was 15, 62, and 23 En% resp. 49% of EI was taken during the race resulting in a CHO intake of 94 g·h-1 representing 69 en%. It is questioned whether this amount of CHO is optimal in relation to CHO oxidation and performance. About 30% from CHO intake came from CHO-rich liquids. High E1 resulted in high Ca and Fe intake. For vitamins, especially B1, this relation was not found. Vitamin B1 nutrient density dropped to 0.25 mg/4.2 MJ during the race caused by a large intake of refined CHO-rich food items. However, vitamin supplementation was high. Daily water intake was 6.7 l with extremes up to 11.8 l. Therefore, the strategy of intake of large quantities of CHO-rich liquids seems to be the appropriate answer to maintain energy and fluid balance under these extreme conditions.","","carbohydrate; vitamin; adult; controlled study; cycling; diet; endurance; energy expenditure; exercise; food intake; human; male; normal human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01724622","","IJSMD","2744926","English","INT.

Triathletes and track cyclists were the first to race in more crouched and upper body down (aero) positions in the early eighties. Professional and amateur road racers have only been using aero handlebars for time-trailing since Greg Lemond's 1989 Tour de France win on the new clip-on aerobar. In the present study we investigated how aero-bar position influences the pedal force pattern in comparison with three other classical racing positions. 9 male elite bicycle racers were tested for index of effectiveness (IE: defined as the ratio of effective to resultant pedal forces); oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and heart rate in four different racing positions. The subjects rode their own racing bicycles on a wind braked roller at 70% of their individual V̇O2max (302.4 W +/- 27.8 W), with a randomized sequence of positions, which were as follows: 1) UF: upright position, flat terrain, cadence 90 rpm. 2) UU: upright, uphill (8% incline), 70 rpm. 3) DF: drop bar position, flat, 90 rpm. 4) AF: aerobar position, flat, 90 rpm. IE was found to be highest in UU with 0.615 (significant). The IE obtained for AF (0.483) was significantly lower than IE of UF (0.509). When this biomechanical figure was compared to the incurred metabolic cost measured as V̇O2, no correlation could be demonstrated, although V̇O2 values were higher by 1.2 ml·kg-1·min-1 in AF than in UF. We conclude that extreme aero positions have a negative influence on pedal force IE. The negative biomechanical consequences of aerocycling do not explain the increased metabolic cost, however. The involvement of other factors must be considered. When aerodynamic gain between upright and aero position is estimated (power savings of close to 100 W) and compared to the measured metabolic cost (8 W) at this level of performance (mechanical output of 300 W), it became evident that a reduction in air drag has first priority when striving for higher speeds.","air-drag; efficiency; ergometer","adult; article; athlete; biomechanics; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cycling; ergometry; human; human experiment; male; normal human; randomized controlled trial; sports medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10226699","","SZSSE","","German","SPORT SCHWEIZ.

The rate of response was 45% with 785 persons asked by phone. According to the survey, 59.9% of the Swiss population support a strict prohibition of doping, 34.8% support the use under medical control and 5.7% vote for a general legalisation. These proportions were independent from age, region and education. There was, however, a characteristic influence of gender, as significantly more men than women were voting for a legalisation. Thus, with regard to further opinions the three groups favoring <<prohibition>>, <<use under medical control>> and <<legalisation>> showed significant differences: 76% of the group <<prohibition>> felt that outstanding performances can be achieved without doping, while only 49% of the group <<use under medical control>> and 53% of the group <<legalisation>> agree. The majority of the group <<use under medical control>> (59%) considers international success of Swiss elite athletes as important versus 33% of the group <<legalisation>>. 95% of the group <<prohibition>>, 86% of the group <<use under medical control>> and 69% of the group <<legalisation>> consider the use of doping in sport as a <<very serious problem>> or a <<somewhat serious problem>>. 73% of the group <<prohibition>> and 50% of the group <<use under medical control>> were disappointed by the confessions made by some professional cyclists during the Tour de France in 1998, with only 33% of the group <<legalisation>>. Participants of all three groups (97% of the group <<prohibition>>, 92% of the group <<use under medical control>> and 84% of the group <<legalisation>>) agree that doping threatens the athletes' health. The present survey confirms that a majority of the Swiss population supports a strict prohibition of doping in sports, for reasons, among others, of serious concerns about the health of athletes. The number of persons supporting use of doping under medical control is surprisingly high and shows the need for better information through experts. It is also surprising that the rather small number of people supporting the legalisation of doping rates the importance of success of Swiss elite athletes as quite low.","","article; athlete; attitude; doping; sports medicine; Switzerland","","","","","","","Schweiz.

Nevertheless, hair analysis could be a promising tool when testing for periods that are not accessible to urinalysis any more. We have developed different sensitive methods for testing hair for amphetamines, anabolic steroids and their esters and corticosteroids. For amphetamines, 50 mg of hair were digested with 1 M NaOH, extracted with ethyl acetate, derivatized with TFA and analyzed by gas chromatography positive chemical-ionization mass spectrometry. For corticosteroids, 50 mg of powdered hair were treated with methanol in an ultrasonic bath and subsequently purified using a C18 solid phase extraction column. Analysis was realized by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry. For anabolic steroids and their esters, 100 mg of powdered hair were treated with methanol in an ultrasonic bath for extraction of esters, then alkaline digested with 1 M NaOH for an optimum recovery of other drugs. The two liquid preparations were subsequently extracted with ethyl acetate, pooled, then finally highly purified using a twin solid phase extraction on aminopropyl and silica cartridges. Residue was derivatized with MSTFA prior to injection. Analysis was conducted by gas chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Thirty cyclists were sampled and tested both in hair and in urine. Amphetamine was detected 10 times in hair (out of 19 analyses) compared to 6 times in urine (out of 30 analyses). Corticosteroids were detected 5 times in hair (methylprednisolone 1 case, triamcinolone acetonide 3 cases and hydrocortisone acetate 1 case) in hair (out of 12 analyses) compared to 12 times (triamcinolone acetonide 10 cases and betamethasone 2 cases) in urine (out of 30 analyses). Anabolic steroids were detected twice (nandrolone 1 case, and testosterone undecanoate 1 case) in hair (out of 25 analyses) compared to none in urine (out of 30 analyses).

If the physical program training progressed much these last years, the techniques of mental preparations are still very heterogeneous and are not based on any validated procedures, based only on individual practices. Nevertheless, the majority of athletes and trainers stress the major importance of «mental» in the realization of performances. One of the obstacles in the mental training of the athletes is the difficulty in finding tools making it possible to evaluate and measure the psychic state of the individual and its mode of coping and adjustment, apart from any psychopathology. Few studies have been carried out on applicability of the personality questionnaires derived from the current dimensional models in these populations. Our study aimed to describe the personality of the members of the french junior team of road cycling, using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) developped by Cloninger to explore the seven dimensions of his psychobiologic model of personality. In this model, four dimensions are temperament factors, and three are character factors. The three main dimensions of temperament are Novelty Seeking (NS), ie the tendency towards excitement in response to novel or rewarding stimuli, Harm Avoidance (HA) hypothesized to represent the tendency to respond intensely to signals of adverse stimuli, and Reward Dependence reflecting the tendency to respond intensely to signals of reward and to maintain behavior previously associated with reward. These personality traits are hypothetically related to underlying neurotransmetter systems (especially NS to dopaminergic function and HA to serotonergic function). The two main dimensions of character are Self-Directedness (SD) and Cooperativeness (C), measuring maturity traits respectively concerning individual and social adaptation. In this study, we used a computerized version of the TCI in a sample of 18 racing cyclists, ie all the members of the french junior national team. Their results were compared to those of 26 male, young, community subjects, derived from the french normative validation sample of the TCI. Mean comparisons were performed with the Mann-Whitney test, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A significant difference between subjects and controls was obtained for Reward Dependance (p < 0.0001), attachment RD3 (p < 0.0001), and dependence RD4 (p < 0.0025). No significant difference appeared between both groups for the other temperament or character dimensions. Based on temperamental Cloninger typology, the type «passionate» appeared to be the most frequent in this sample (55.6 %). These results suggested that the TCI can be easily and usefully used in athletes, and that the personality profile of young competitive cyclists is not abnormal except a high level of reward dependence. Numerous applications can be derived from this use: the development of specific and personalized mental training, the screening and prevention of psychological vulnerability.","Character; Personality; Sport; TCI; Temperament","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Bicycling; Brain; Character; Cooperative Behavior; Dopamine; Humans; Male; Personality Inventory; Sports; Temperament; Travel; dopamine; article; automation; character; controlled study; cooperation; cycling; dopaminergic system; France; human; hypothesis; neurotransmission; personality test; psychobiology; reward; screening test; serotoninergic system; social adaptation; sport; temperament; training; adaptive behavior; adolescent; bicycle; brain; male; metabolism; psychological aspect; sport; travel","","dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; Dopamine, 51-61-6","","","","","Backmand H., Kaprio J., Kujala U., Et al., Personality and mood of former elite male athletes - A descriptive study, Int J Sports Med, 22, pp. 215-221, (2001); Black K.J., Sheline Y.I., Personality disorder scores improve with effective pharmacotherapy of depression, J Affect Dis, 43, pp. 11-18, (1997); Brandtrom S., Schlette P., Przybecktr, Et al., Swedish normative data on personality using the temperament and character inventory, Compr Psychiatry, 39, pp. 122-128, (1998); Brown S.L., Svrakic D.M., Przybeck T.R., Et al., The relationship of personality to mood and anxiety states: A dimensional approach, J Psychiatr Res, 26, pp. 197-211, (1992); Bulik C.M., Sullivan P.F., Joyce P.R., Et al., Temperament, character, and personality disorder in bulimia nervosa, J Nerv Ment Dis, 183, pp. 593-598, (1995); Cloninger C.R., Svrakic N.M., Svrakic D.M., Role of personality self organisation in development of mental order and disorder, Dev Psychopathol, 9, pp. 881-906, (1997); Cloninger C.R., A systematic method for clinical description and classification of personality variants, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 44, pp. 573-588, (1987); Cloninger C.R., Temperament personality, Curr Opin Neurobiol, pp. 4266-4273, (1994); Cloninger C.R., The genetics and psycholobiology of the seven factor model, Biology of Personality Disorders, pp. 63-92, (1998); Cloninger C.R., Bayon C., Svrakic D.M., Measurement of temperament and character in mood disorders: A model of fundamental states as personality types, J Affect Dis, 57, pp. 21-32, (1998); Cloninger C.R., Svrakic D.M., Przybeck T.R., A psychological model of temperament and character, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 50, pp. 975-990, (1993); Goldman R.G., Skodol A.E., McGrath P.J., Et al., Relationship between the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire and DSM III-R personality traits, Am J Psychiatry, 151, pp. 274-276, (1994); Howard M.O., Kivlhan D., Walker R.D., Cloninger's tridimensional theory of personality and psychopathology: Applications to substance use disorders, J Stud Alcohol, 58, pp. 48-66, (1997); Joyce P.R., Mulder R.T., Cloninger C.R., Temperament predicts clomipramine and desipramine response in major depression, J Affect Dis, 30, pp. 35-46, (1994); Kleifield E.I., Sunday S., Hurt S., Et al., Psychometric validation of the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire: Application to subgroup of eating disorders, Compr Psychiatry, 34, pp. 249-253, (1993); Lepine J.P., Pelissolo A., Teodorescu R., Et al., Evaluation des propriétés psychométriques de la version française du Questionnaire tridimensionnel de la personnalité (TPQ), Encephale, 20, pp. 747-753, (1994); Lox C.L., Burns S.P., Treasure D.C., Et al., Physical and psychological predictors of exercise dosage in healthy adults, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 31, pp. 1060-1064, (1999); Michel G., Carton S., Jouvent R., Recherche de sensation et anhédonie et prise de risque.

Methods: We measured the cadence of seven professional cyclists (28 ± 1 yr) during 3-wk road races (Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and Vuelta a Espafĩa) involving three main competition requirements: uphill cycling (high mountain passes of ∼15 km, or HM); individual time trials of ∼50 km on level ground (TT); and flat, long (∼190 km) group stages (F). Heart rate (HR) data were also recorded as an indicator of exercise intensity during HM, TT, and F. Results: Mean cadence was significantly lower (P < 0.01) during HM (71.0 ± 1.4 rpm) than either F and TT (89.3 ± 1.0 and 92.4 ± 1.3 rpm, respectively). HR was similar during HM and TT (157 ± 4 and 158 ± 3 bpm) and in both cases higher (P < 0.01) than during F (124 ± 2 bpm). Conclusion: During both F and TT, professional riders spontaneously adopt higher cadences (around 90 rpm) than those previously reported in the majority of laboratory studies as being the most economical. In contrast, during HM they seem to adopt a more economical pedalling rate (∼70 rpm), possibly as a result of the specific demands of this competition phase.","Cyclists; Heart rate; Pedalling frequency","article; cycling; exercise; heart rate; human; human experiment; normal human; outcomes research; velocity","","","","","","","Guidelines for Exercise Testing, and Prescription, pp. 95-96, (1986); Anholm J.D., Milne E.N., Stark P., Bourne J.C., Friedman P., Radiographic evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema after exercise at altitude, J.

Methods: The HR responses of 18 world class cyclists were recorded during the races and compared with HR ranges that corresponded to four intensities of exercise that were measured in the laboratory with an incremental test to exhaustion 2 wk before each race. The four intensities were: Anaerobic (AN) over the individual anaerobic threshold, which was over 90% of V̇O(2max); intense aerobic (IA), which was between 70 and 90% of V̇O(2max); moderate aerobic (MA), which was between 50 and 70% of V̇O(2max); and recovery (RE), which was < 50% of V̇O(2max). The stages were divided in individual time trial (ITT), flat, or mountain. Results: The mean HR of the Vuelta and Tour were, respectively, 133.8 ± 17.9 and 134 ± 18.6 beats·min-1. The mean total time of each stage was 269.6 ± 122 and 259.4 ± 119.9 min. The mean stage time over IAT was 17.5 ± 15.7 and 24.7 ± 26 min; the IA time was 75.2 ± 47.6 and 79.6 ± 48.3 min; the MA was 97.2 ± 57.4 and 89.5 ± 54.9 min. Finally the RE time was 79.6 ± 60.5 and 65.4 ± 69.7 min. The percentage of participation related to total time of the race was, respectively, in the Vuelta and the Tour, 12.99 and 16.8% in AN exercise intensity, 29.5 and 29.2% in IA, 32.4 and 31.9% in MA, and 25.1 and 25.2% in RE. There are no differences in AN time among flat, mountain, and ITT stages in each race, except for the mountain stages in the Tour. Conclusion: Cycling is a high intensity sport because approximately 93 min in flat and 123 min in mountain stages were above 70% of V̇O(2max). In addition, the time spent at IAT was roughly 20 min regardless of stage type, suggesting that the anaerobic capacity limits performance.","Anaerobic Threshold; Exercise Intensity; Exercise Quantification; Heart Rate; Metabolic Intensities; Oxygen Uptake","Adult; Anaerobic Threshold; Bicycling; Competitive Behavior; Exertion; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; anaerobic threshold; article; cycling; exercise; France; heart rate; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; normal human; oxygen consumption; Spain","","","","","","","Brouns F., Saris W.H.M., Stroecken J., Et al., Eating, drinking and cycling: A controlled Tour de France simulation study.

Many authors have suggested that SusMR of various wild animal species are only a few times resting (basal or standard) metabolic rates (RMR). We test this conclusion by analyzing all 37 species (humans, 31 other endothermic vertebrates, and 5 ectothermic vertebrates) for which SusMR and RMR had both been measured. For all species, the ratio of SusMR to RMR, which we term sustained metabolic scope, is less than 7; most values fall between 1.5 and 5. Some of these values, such as those for Tour de France cyclists and breeding birds, are surely close to sustainable metabolic ceilings for the species studied. That is, metabolic rates higher than 7 times RMR apparently cannot be sustained indefinitely. These observations pose several questions: whether the proximate physiological causes of metabolic ceilings reside in the digestive tract's ability to process food or in each tissue's metabolic capacity; whether ceiling values are independent of the mode of energy expenditure; whether ceilings are set by single limiting physiological capacities or by coadjusted clusters of capacities (symmorphosis); what the ultimate evolutionary causes of metabolic ceilings are; and how metabolic ceilings may limit animals' reproductive effort, foraging behavior, and geographic distribution.","Doubly labeled water; Exercise; Metabolic ceiling; Metabolic rate; Symmorphosis","Animalia; Aves; Vertebrata; Mammalia; digestion; metabolic rate; article; bird; mammal; metabolism; priority journal; reproduction","","","","","","","Bartholomew G.A., Animal Physiology: Principles and Adaptations, pp. 46-93, (1982); Benett A.F., Ruben J.A., Science, 206, pp. 649-654, (1979); Schmidt-Nielsen K., Scaling: Why Is Animal Size So Important?, (1984); Westerterp K.R., Saris W.H.M., Van Es M., Ten Hoor F., J.

Rehabilitation programs which stress strengthening exercises as well as impact loading activities increase the bone mass. On the other side activity level early in life has not been proven to correlate with increased bone mineral content later in life. Little is known on the influence of high performance sports on the bone density especially in athletes with high demands on weight bearing of the spine. In (n = 40) internationally top ranked high performance athletes of different disciplines (n = 28 weight-lifters, n = 6 sports-boxers and n = 6 bicycle-racers) bone density measurements of the lumbar spine and the left hip were performed. The measurements were carried out by dual-photonabsorptiometry (DEXA; QDR2000, Siemens) and evaluated by an interactive software-programm (Hologic Inc.). The results were compared to the measurements of 21 age-matched male control individuals. In the high performance weight lifters there was an increase of bone density compared to the control individuals of 23% in the lumbar spine, 29% in the left hip and 46% in the Ward's triangle (p < 0.01). The sports-boxers had an increase up to 17% (lumbar spine), 9% (hip) and 7% (Ward's triangle). In the third athletes group (Tour de France-bikers) BMD was decreased 10% in the lumbar spine, 14% in the hip and 17% in the Ward's triangle. Our results show that training programs stressing axial loads of the skeletal system may lead to an increase of BMD in the spine and the hip of young individuals. Other authors findings, that the BMD of endurance athletes may decrease, is confirmed. Nevertheless the bikers BMD-loss of 10 to 17% was surprisingly high.","Bone mineral density; Dual energy absorptiometry; High performance; Physical activity","article; athlete; bone density; controlled study; exercise; human; male; normal human; sports and sport related phenomena","","","","","","","Bilanin J.E., Blanchard M.S., Russek-Cohen E., Lower vertebral bone density in male long distance runners, Med.

Universitaire de Medecine Leg., Lausanne, Switzerland","Since 1997, the International Cycling Union (ICU) and the Institut Universitaire de Medecine Legale de Lausanne (IUML) have undertaken a medical program to prevent professional cyclists from abusing of recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO). This program is based on the measurement of the haematocrit only. During several races organised by the ICU, blood samples are randomly collected from the sportsmen in the morning before breakfast and exercise. Then, the haematocrit is analysed online and all values exceeding 50% imply that the cyclists have to stop racing for a minimum period of two weeks. Cyclists with a physiological haematocrit above 50% can have a certificate delivered by the ICU. During the 1999 Tour de Suisse (TDS) in Lausanne, all cyclists (n = 146) had to give a blood sample before the start of a single stage. The haematocrits and other parameters related to the erythropoiesis, the iron metabolism and the liver function were measured. The parameters observed during this major race ('Hors Classe'), just a fortnight before the Tour de France were the following: 5 cyclists had a haematocrit exceeding 50%, but one of them had a certificate. A narrow haematocrit distribution was observed in some teams and more than 50% of the cyclists had ferritin levels above 300 ng/ml. Most of the ferritin levels were also related to the teams. 5 men had an EPO level above the reference interval established by the manufacturer. The main potential secondary marker mentioned in the literature indicating an abuse of rhEPO, the sTFR (soluble transferrin receptor), was not out of range. On the other hand, the reticulocyte indices (absolute count, percentage, IRF) showed a large inter and intra team variability. These high or low values could be normal, due to some pathologies or some manipulations of the erythropoiesis thanks to high altitude training, hypobaric chamber sessions or rhEPO treatments. Without a proper medical follow up or at least a second blood test taken a few days later, it is difficult or even impossible to determine whether someone has manipulated his haematopoietic activity.","","ferritin; recombinant erythropoietin; adult; article; cycling; drug abuse; erythropoiesis; exercise; ferritin blood level; human; iron metabolism; liver function test; major clinical study; male; sports medicine; Switzerland","","ferritin, 9007-73-2; recombinant erythropoietin, 113427-24-0, 122312-54-3, 130455-76-4","","","","","Wide L., Bengtsson C., Berglund B., Ekblom B., Detection in blood and urine of recombinant erythropoietin administrated to healthy men, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 27, 11, pp. 1569-1576, (1995); Wide L., Bengtsson C., Molecular charge heterogeneity of human serum erythropoietin, British Journal of Haematology, 76, 1, pp. 121-127, (1990); (1997); Breymann C., Bauer C., Major A., Zimmermann R., Gautschi K., Huch A., Huch R., Optimal timing of repeated rh-erythropoietin administration improves its effectiveness in stimulating erythropoiesis in healthy volunteers, British Journal of Haematology, 92, 2, pp. 295-301, (1996); Casoni I., Ricci G., Ballarin E., Borsetto C., Grazzi G., Guglielmini C., Manfredini F., Mazzoni G., Patracchini M., De Paoli Vitali E., Et al., Hematological indices of erythropoietin administration in athletes, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 6, pp. 307-311, (1993); Major A., Bauer C., Breymann C., Huch A., Huch R., rh-erythropoietin stimulates immature reticulocyte release in man, British Journal of Haematology, 87, 3, pp. 605-608, (1994); Brugnara C., Colella G.M., Cremins J., Langley R.C.

Methods: Seven professional road cyclists (28 ± 1 yr; VO2max: 74.6 ± 2.2 mL·kg-1·min-1) who participated in both Tour and Vuelta during the years 1997, 1999, 2000, or 2001 were collected as subjects. They wore a heart rate (HR) telemeter during each stage of the two races, and exercise intensity was divided into three phases according to the reference HR values obtained during a previous ramp cycle-ergometer test: phase I (<ventilatory threshold (VT)), phase II (between VT and the respiratory compensation point (RCP)) and phase III (>RCP). Total volume and intensity were integrated as a single variable. The score for volume × intensity in each phase was computed by multiplying the accumulated duration in this phase by a multiplier for this particular phase. The total score for Tour and Vuelta was obtained by summating the results of the three phases. Results: The total loads (volume × intensity) did not significantly differ between the two races (P > 0.05), despite a significantly longer total exercise time of the Tour (P < 0.05) (5552 ± 176 vs 5086 ± 290 min). Conclusion: The physiological loads imposed on cyclists' bodies do not differ between the Tour and Vuelta, despite the longer duration of daily stages in the former race.","Cycling; Heart rate; Intensity; Telemeter; Volume","Adult; Anaerobic Threshold; Bicycling; Competitive Behavior; Energy Metabolism; Ergometry; Exertion; France; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Endurance; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Spain; adult; article; bicycle ergometer; clinical article; competition; cycling; exercise; heart rate; human; oxygen consumption","","","","","","","Banister E.W., Modeling elite athletic performance, Physiological Testing of Elite Athletes, pp. 403-424, (1991); Banister E.W., Carter J.B., Zarkadas P.C., Training theory and taper: Validation in triathlon athletes, Eur.

The objective of the study is to describe differences between males and females regarding accidents, and to explain the main reasons for these differences. Methods: Analysis is conducted from both national police data (2001) and data from the Rhône medical road accident trauma Register (1996-2001). Results: The male/female incidence rate is 3.1 for mortality (95% CI: 3.0-3.3) and 1.7 for morbidity (95% CI: 1.7-1.8). Two-wheel motorised vehicle accidents are very specific to males, which explains part of this overrepresentation. The fatality rate and the severe injuries rate among survivors are higher for males. This is true for every main user group (car users, motorised two-wheelers, cyclists, pedestrians) after adjusting for accident circumstances and age of casualties. Males are more severely injured for all body regions and have more often severe after-effects. Conclusions: This paper shows the mechanisms leading to this unfavourable outcome for men. They correspond to differences in the number of trips, in the choice of road transport types, and moreover to differences in risk-taking behaviours. Underlying these behaviours, deep-rooted, strong and rather invariant differences between genders are to be found in the values associated with risk-taking on the road.","Epidemiology; France; Gender; Road crash; Sex","article; cycling; data analysis; France; incidence; injury; motor vehicle; outcomes research; sex difference; sex ratio; social behavior; traffic accident","","","","","","","Evans L., Traffic Safety and the Driver, (1991); La Sécurité Routière en France.

Rominger in November 1994 at sea level (Bordeaux, France). However, maximal aerobic cycling performances can be expected to increase at altitude because, for a given air temperature, air density decreases more than VO2max. The combined effect of these opposite trends results in an improvement of performances. In this study, based on the aerodynamics of track cycling, and assuming an average decrease of VO2max with altitude as from the literature, we show that the ideal altitude for Rominger is 4000 m where he could cover 60.1 km in 1 h. To our knowledge, only two cyclists attempted at close time intervals to set the 1 h record at sea level and at altitude (Mexico, 2230 m above sea level): F. Moser and J. Longo. Their increase of performance with altitude was only about 50% of that predicted on the basis of similar calculations as performed on Rominger. This suggests that the decrease of VO2max resulting from altitude is greater for athletes than for average trained subjects and/or that the fraction of VO2max that can be maintained throughout 1 h decreases with altitude. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Altitude; Best performances; Cycling; Energy cost of cycling","Altitude; Bicycling; Biomechanics; Exertion; Human; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Oxygen Consumption; air temperature; altitude acclimatization; article; atmospheric pressure; case report; cycling; energy cost; human; mathematical analysis; oxygen breathing; physical performance; priority journal","","","","","","","Capelli C., Rosa G., Butti F., Ferretti G., Veicsteinas A., di Prampero P.E., Energy cost and efficiency of riding aerodynamic bicycles, Eur J Appl Physiol, 67, pp. 144-149, (1993); Cerretelli P., Energy metabolism during exercise at altitude, Medicine sport, pp. 175-190, (1981); di Prampero P.E., Cortili G., Mognoni P., Saibene F., Equation of motion of a cyclist, J Appl Physiol, 47, pp. 201-206, (1979); di Prampero P.E., The energy cost of human locomotion on land and in water, Int J Sports Med, 7, pp. 55-72, (1986); di Prampero P.E., Capelli C., Pagliaro P., Antonutto G., Girardis M., Zamparo P., Soule R.G., Energetics of best performances in middle-distance running, J Appl Physiol, 74, pp. 2318-2324, (1993); Pugh L.G.C.E., Gill M.B., Lahiri S., Muscular exercise at great altitude, J Appl Physiol, 19, pp. 431-440, (1964); Snow J.E., Drela M., Record conditions for cycling, Nature, 371, (1994); West J.B., Boyer S.J., Graber D.J., Maximal exercise at extreme altitude on Mount Everest, J Appl Physiol, 55, pp. 688-698, (1983)","","","Springer-Verlag","","","","","","14396327","","EJAPC","8565981","English","Europ.

Heart rate telemetry during the races allowed the exercise intensity to be classified into three phases: I, below the first ventilatory threshold (VT1); II, between VT1 and the second ventilatory threshold (VT2); III, above VT2. Compared with the Giro and Tour, the lower exercise volume of the Vuelta (about 20% less total time) was compensated for by a considerably lower and higher contribution of phases I and III respectively. As a result, the total load (volume x intensity) in the three races was comparable.","","Adult; Bicycling; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Physical Endurance; Respiratory Mechanics; Time Factors; adult; article; body mass; case report; clinical examination; comparative study; endocrine system; exercise; exercise test; exercise tolerance; food intake; heart function; heart rate; hormonal regulation; human; lung ventilation; male; nutrition; seasonal variation; telemetry; time; training","","","","","","","Fernandez-Garcia B.J., Perez-Landaluce J., Rodriguez-Alonso M., Et al., Intensity of exercise during road race pro-cycling competition, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 1002-1006, (2000); Lucia A., Hoyos J., Carvajal A., Et al., Heart rate response to professional road cycling: The Tour de France, Int J Sports Med, 20, pp. 167-172, (1999); Lucia A., Hoyos J., Chicharro J.L., Preferred pedaling cadence in professional cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 33, pp. 1361-1366, (2001); Padilla S., Mujika I., Orbananos J., Et al., Exercise intensity during competition time trials in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 850-856, (2000); Padilla S., Mujika I., Orbananos J., Et al., Exercise intensity and load during mass-start stage races in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 33, pp. 796-802, (2001); Lucia A., Diaz B., Hoyos J., Et al., Hormone levels of world class cyclists during the Tour of Spain stage race, Br J Sports Med, 35, pp. 424-430, (2001); Lucia A., Hoyos J., Perez M., Et al., Heart rate and performance parameters in elite cyclists: A longitudinal study, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 1777-1782, (2000); Garcia-Roves P.M., Terrados N., Fernandez S.F., Et al., Macronutrient intake of top level cyclists during continuous competition-change in the feeding pattern, Int J Sports Med, 19, pp. 61-67, (1998); Garcia-Roves P.M., Terrados N., Fernandez S., Et al., Comparison of dietary intake and eating behavior of professional road cyclists during training and competition, Int J Sports Med, 10, pp. 82-98, (2000); Saris W.H.M., Van Erp-Baart M.A., Brouns F., Westerterp K.R., Ten Hoor F., Study on food intake and energy expenditure during extreme sustained exercise: The Tour de France, Int J Sports Med, 10, SUPPL., (1989); Faulkner J.A., Physiology of swimming and diving, Exercise Physiology, pp. 415-445, (1968); Foster C., Florhaug J.A., Franklin J., Et al., A new approach to monitoring exercise training, J Strength Cond Res, 15, pp. 109-115, (2001)","A.

The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of intensive cycling exercise, with an energy expenditure comparable to values derived from the Tour de France, on food and fluid intake, energy balance, nitrogen balance, and nutrient oxidation. Thirteen highly trained cyclists consuming a normal carbohydrate (CHO)-rich diet (60 En%) were studied during a 7-day stay in a respiration chamber. Two preparation days were followed by a standardized resting day (3), after which the subjects completed two exhausting exercise days (4-5). On day 6 the standardized resting day was repeated. Food and fluid intake were measured by weighed procedure. Energy expenditure was calculated from continuous gas analysis. Energy and nitrogen losses were calculated from all measured excretes. The results showed that energy balance (EB) and nitrogen balance (NB) were positive on the first resting day and became negative on the exercise days. EB was positive again on the recovery day whereas NB remained negative. Nitrogen losses almost balanced N intakes (1.7 g·kg-1) indicating an increased protein requirement. CHO oxidation exceeded CHO intake indicating endogenous CHO depletion. Contribution of CHO to energy exchange decreased from 51.4% ± 3.1% on day 4 to 40.6% ± 3.4% on day 5; this decrease was compensated by an increased fat oxidation. The food consumption pattern during days 4 and 5 was not different from days 2 and 6. In between meal consumption accounted for 30.5%-34.3% of total energy intake. Fluid consumption was adequate to compensate for the losses. These findings suggest an increased protein and carbohydrate requirement during days of prolonged intensive exercise and an upper limit of energy intake (20 MJ) when consuming a normal CHO-rich diet.","","adult; controlled study; cycling; diet; energy balance; fluid intake; food intake; human; male; nitrogen balance; normal human; nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01724622","","IJSMD","2663741","English","INT.

The success of roundabouts is explained, first, by the ideal safety conditions that this type of intersection presents and, second, by the advantages roundabouts provide in speed reduction, suitability to traffic, and break effect. The growth of roundabouts in recent years has allowed better understanding of this type of layout and has enabled all uses to be tested. The rules for designing and sizing have developed to favor the construction of roundabouts that are smaller and thus easier to fit into the urban environment. Vulnerable users (pedestrians and cyclists) are catered to better. New configurations are appearing that combine traffic lights and roundabouts, and these should be investigated in depth. Furthermore, it appears that the roundabout is subject to fashion and that many changes are planned to the roundabout-forgetting that it is not always the best solution. Also, it is important to remind designers and architects of the conditions under which the roundabout actually is an adequate solution for the site in question.","","Accident prevention; Highway traffic control; Intersections; Urban planning; Roundabout intersections; Visual break effect; Highway engineering","","","","","","","La France des Giratoires, 1994 Census, (1996); Girabase, (1999); Urban Intersection Guidebook, (1999); Guide: Mini-Roundabouts, Regulations and Recommendations, (1997)","","","National Research Council","","","","","","03611981","","TRRED","","English","Transp Res Rec","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034433990"

Although the final overall standings of a race are individual, it is undoubtedly a team sport. Professional road cyclists present with variable anthropometric values, but display impressive aerobic capacities [maximal power output 370 to 570W, maximal oxygen uptake 4.4 to 6.4 L/min and power output at the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) 300 to 500W]. Because of the variable anthropometric characteristics, 'specialists' have evolved within teams whose job is to perform in different terrain and racing conditions. In this respect, power outputs relative to mass exponents of 0.32 and 1 seem to be the best predictors of level ground and uphill cycling ability, respectively. However, time trial specialists have been shown to meet requirements to be top competitors in all terrain (level and uphill) and cycling conditions (individually and in a group). Based on competition heart rate measurements, time trials are raced under steady-state conditions, the shorter time trials being raced at average intensities close to OBLA (≈400 to 420W), with the longer ones close to the individual lactate threshold (LT, ≈370 to 390W). Mass-start stages, on the other hand, are raced at low mean intensities (≈210W for the flat stages, ≈270W for the high mountain stages), but are characterised by their intermittent nature, with cyclists spending on average 30 to 100 minutes at, and above LT, and 5 to 20 minutes at, and above OBLA.","","Adult; Anthropometry; Bicycling; Ergometry; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; lactic acid; aerobic metabolism; anthropometry; athlete; cycling; heart rate; human; lactate blood level; male; review; sports medicine; steady state","","","","","","","The Hub [online]; Padilla S., Mujika I., Cuesta G., Et al., Validity of a velodrome test for competitive road cyclists, Eur J Appl Physiol, 73, pp. 446-451, (1996); Padilla S., Mujika I., Cuesta G., Et al., Level ground and uphill cycling ability in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 31, 6, pp. 878-885, (1999); Padilla S., Mujika I., Orbananos J., Et al., Exercise intensity during competition time trials in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, 4, pp. 850-856, (2000); astrand P.O., Work tests with the bicycle ergometer; Fernandez-Garcia B., Perez-Landaluce J., Rodriguez-Alonso M., Et al., Intensity of exercise during road race pro-cycling competition, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, 5, pp. 1002-1006, (2000); Lucia L., Hoyos J., Carvajal A., Et al., Heart rate response to professional road cycling: The Tour de France, Int J Sports Med, 20, pp. 167-172, (1999); Lucia L., Pardo J., Durantez A., Et al., Physiological differences between professional and elite road cyclists, Int J Sports Med, 19, pp. 342-348, (1998); Padilla S., Mujika I., Angulo F., Et al., Scientific approach to the 1-h cycling world record: A case study, J Appl Physiol, 89, pp. 1522-1527, (2000); Swain D.P., Coast J.R., Clifford P.S., Et al., Influence of body size on oxygen consumption during bicycling, J Appl Physiol, 62, pp. 668-672, (1987); Swain D.P., The influence of body mass in endurance bicycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 26, pp. 58-63, (1994); Padilla S., Mujika I., Orbananos J., Et al., Exercise intensity and load during mass-start stage races in professional road cycling, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 33, pp. 796-802, (2001); Palmer G.S., Hawley J.A., Dennis S.C., Et al., Heart rate responses during a 4-d cycle stage race, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 26, pp. 1278-1283, (1994); Jeukendrup A., Van Diemen A., Heart rate monitoring during training and competition in cyclists, J Sports Sci, 16, pp. S91-S99, (1998); Palmer G.S., Martin D.T., McLean B.D., Et al., Heart rate does not accurately reflect power output during professional cycling competition, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, (2000); Banister E.W., Modeling elite athletic performance, Human Kinetics, pp. 403-424, (1991)","","","","","","","","","01121642","","","11428685","English","Sports Med.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034987716"

Population-adjusted bicycle and passenger car death rates in France, the United States, and the Netherlands provide context for understanding bicycle use and safety behavior. Observation data on helmet use and use of lights at night are also presented. Boston has the fewest bicycles per hour at 55, Paris is next at 74, compared to 242 cyclists per hour in Amsterdam. In Boston, 32% of cyclists wore helmets versus only 2.4% of Paris cyclists and only 0.1% of Amsterdam cyclists. In contrast, Paris cyclists were far more likely to use lights at night (45.2%) than Boston cyclists (15.6%) or Amsterdam cyclists (7.6%). With bicycle and car deaths as the numerators, and French, U.S., and Dutch populations as the denominators, the Netherlands appears to have a dramatically lower death rate for people in passenger cars and for the combined group of cyclists and passenger car occupants. Transportation safety policies in the Netherlands appear to be working better than regulations in the United States or France. Politicians, transportation planners, and safety experts can learn from the Dutch about how to promote cycling and build a safe bicycle-friendly environment.","","","","","","","","","Fourth World Conference on Injury Prevention and Control in Amsterdam, (1998); Levinson H.S., Cities, Transportation and Change, Transportation Quarterly, 50, 4, pp. 67-85, (1996); Heidenheimer A.J., Heclo H., Adams C.T., Comparative Public Policy: The Politics of Social Choice in Europe and America, (1983); Fegan J.C., Increasing the Use and Safety of Bicycling and Walking in the United States, Velo-City Conference '95, (1998); Giovannangeli F., The Rentrée: Vélo & Myriaflow, Paris Kiosque, 3, 10, (1998); Chaumien J., Le Vélo en France: Du résiduel à l'enjeu électoral, Velo-City Conference '95, (1998); Chaumien J., Le Vélo en France: Du résiduel à l'enjeu électoral, Velo-City Conference '95, (1998); (1998); (1998); Poulsen E., European Cyclist's Federation Position Paper Cycle Helmets, (1995); Heran F., La Ville Cyclable: Concept, Conditions et Impacts, Velo-City Conference '95, (1998); Heran F., La Ville Cyclable: Concept, Conditions et Impacts, Velo-City Conference '95, (1998); Ochia K., Bicycle Programs and Provision of Bikeway Facilities in the United States, Transportation Quarterly, 47, 3, pp. 445-456, (1993); Massachusetts Statewide Bicycle Transportation Plan, (1998); Williams J., Larson J., Promoting Bicycle Commuting: Understanding the Customer, Transportation Quarterly, 50, 3, pp. 67-78, (1996); Grava S., Traffic Calming - Can It Be Done in America?, Transportation Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 483-505, (1993); (1998); Jacobs J., The Death and Life of Great American Cities, (1961); Seijts G.H.P., Kok G., Bouter L.M., Klip H.A.J., Barriers to Wearing Bicycle Safety Helmets in the Netherlands, Archives Pediatric Adolescent Medicine, 149, pp. 174-180, (1995); Injury-Control Recommendations: Bicycle Helmets, MMWR, 44, RR-1, pp. 1-18, (1995); Friede A.M., Azzara C.V., Gallagher S.S., Guyer B., The Epidemiology of Injuries to Bicycle Riders, Pediatric Clinics of North America, 32, pp. 141-151, (1985); Jaffe K.M., Massagli T.L., Martin K.M., Rivara J.B., Fay G.C., Polissar N.L., Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury: Acute and Rehabilitation Costs, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 74, 7, (1993); Injury-Control Recommendations: Bicycle Helmets; Di Guisseppi C.G., Rivara F.P., Koepsell T.D., Polissar L., Bicycle Helmet Use by Children: Evaluation of a Community-wide Helmet Campaign, Journal of the American Medical Association, 262, pp. 2256-2261, (1989); Howland J., Et al., Barriers to Bicycle Helmet Use among Children: Result of Focus Groups with Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Graders, American Journal of Diseases in Children, 143, pp. 741-744, (1989); Puczynski M., Marshall D.A., Helmetst All the Pros Wear Them, American Journal of Diseases in Children, 146, pp. 1465-1467, (1992); Guttag O.P., Pedestrian, Bicycle and Inline Skating Safety Program Guide, (1997); Welleman T., The Autumn of the Bicycle Master Plan: After the Plan, the Products, Velo-City Conference '95, (1995); Welleman T., The Autumn of the Bicycle Master Plan: After the Plan, the Products, Velo-City Conference '95, (1995); Welleman T., The Autumn of the Bicycle Master Plan: After the Plan, the Products, Velo-City Conference '95, (1995); Suzuki P.T., The National Urban Freeway System of the Netherlands: Transportation Policies and Innovations in a Small Nation, Transportation Quarterly, 38, 4, pp. 551-558, (1984); A Study of Bicycle and Pedestrian Programs in European Countries, (1992); A Study of Bicycle and Pedestrian Programs in European Countries, (1992); Seijts, Et al., Barriers to Wearing Safety Helmets in the United States; Traffic Manual Theory B, (1997); A Study of Bicycle and Pedestrian Programs in European Countries; Suzuki, The National Urban Freeway Systems of the Netherlands; A Study of Bicycle and Pedestrian Programs in European Countries; A Study of Bicycle and Pedestrian Programs in European Countries; Wittink R., Promoting Safe Cycling and Bicycle Use in the Netherlands, Strategic Highway and Traffic Safety on Two Continents (International Conference), (1993); Statistics of Road Traffic Accidents in Europe and North America, (1995); SPSS for Windows (Release 6.1), (1994); Quattro Pro 5.0 for Windows, (1993); Pucher J., A Comparative Analysis of Policies and Travel Behavior in the Soviet Union, Eastern and Western Europe, and North America, Transportation Quarterly, 44, 3, pp. 444-465, (1990); Di Guisseppi, Et al., Bicycle Helmet Use by Children and; Schieber R.A., Kresnow M.J., Sacks J.J., Et al., Effect of a State Law on Reported Bicycle Helmet Ownership and Use, Archives Pediatric Adolescent Medicine, 150, pp. 707-712, (1996); Di Guisseppi, Et al., Bicycle Helmet Use by Children; Rodgers G.B., Bicycle Helmet Use Patterns in the United States.

The assessment of a traffic casualty must include not only the victim but also the vehicle and the circumstances of the accident. Only consideration of all available data permits a better assessment of the mechanism of the crash and causation of injuries. J. M. Thevenet drove the first car carried from France to Japan on February 6, 1898. On October 28th, 1905, the first death by a road traffic accident occurred in Osaka. We performed a retrospective analysis of 279 traffic fatalities examined by medico-legal autopsy in Niigata that occurred over a twenty-two-year period from 1980 to 2001. All persons who had an ICD-10 code were grouped by 153 pedestrians, 43 pedal cyclists, 20 motorcycle riders, 45 car occupants, 11 occupants of pick-up trucks or vans, 4 occupants of heavy transport vehicles and 3 others. The average of ISS (injury scale score) is 40.7 in pedestrians, 26.7 in pedal cyclists, 32.4 in motorcycle riders, 25.1 in car occupants, 16.5 in occupants of pick-up trucks or vans, 24.0 in heavy transport vehicles and 69.0 in others. Rib fractures were observed in 170 cases (60.9%) and the frequency of other injuries was shown in Table 2. Criminal Punishment for drivers involved in 261 traffic accidents amounted to 35 sentences of imprisonment (13.4%), 46 suspension of execution of sentence (17.6%) and 60 sentence of fine (23.0%). Forty prone pedestrians run over by cars showed high ethanol levels in their blood. It was necessary to identify the driver of a vehicle in twelve car accidents and simulation with a computer is very useful. The average of ISS was 34.0 in ten drivers and 22.0 in fourteen fellow passengers. Four sudden natural deaths of drivers at the wheel, eight cases of death immediately after and from one day to five months after road traffic accidents, nine suicides and one intentional accident are excluded from traffic death. Both a medico legal and scientific compensation approach to automobile accident is now necessary.","Criminal punishment compensation scientific approach; Injury scale score (ISS); Road traffic accident","Accidents, Traffic; Autopsy; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Japan; adolescent; adult; alcohol blood level; alcohol consumption; article; autopsy; criminal justice; female; human; injury scale; Japan; major clinical study; male; medicolegal aspect; multiple trauma; punishment; rib fracture; suicide; traffic accident; workman compensation","","","","","","","The Abbreviated Injury Scale, (1990)","","","","","","","","","00471887","","NHOZA","12415831","Japanese","Jpn.

The first vaccine were composed of bacterial suspensions inactivated by heat. This type of vaccine was introduced in France in 1959 and its use generalised in 1966. Very soon afterward a decrease of mortality and morbidity was observed. However, because of differences in the efficacy of these vaccines and their reactogenicity researches were undertaken all around the world in order to set up efficacious and less reactogenic vaccines. These vaccines, called acellular vaccines, are composed of purified detoxified bacterial proteins. After many clinical trials between 1987 and 1997 it was shown that these acellular vaccines are efficacious and less reactogenic for infants. However, they are a little less efficacious than whole-cell vaccines. In France, 30 years after the introduction of whole-cell vaccines, a resurgence of the disease was observed mainly due to the fact that immunity after vaccination wanes. In fact, the vaccine calendar was primary vaccination at 2-3-4 months and one booster at 16-18 months and no other booster because of the increase in the reactogenicity of vaccination. Because of the introduction of the acellular vaccines it was decided to modify the vaccine calendar in 1998 primary vaccination with whole-cell vaccine at 2-3-4 months, and boosters at 16-18 months with either whole-cell vaccine or acellular vaccines, and an additional booster at 11-13 years. © 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.","Tolerance; Whooping cough vaccines","bacterial protein; biken2; dtca1; dtca2; dtca2 pmsv; dtca3; dtca4; dtca5; dtce; dtce pmsv; pertussis vaccine; Bordetella pertussis; clinical trial; comparative study; conference paper; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug tolerability; France; human; immunogenicity; pertussis; suspension; vaccination","","","biken2, Connaught; dtca1, Amvax; dtca2 pmsv, Aventis; dtca2 pmsv, Institut Pasteur; dtca2, SmithKline Beecham; dtca3, Biocine; dtca3, SmithKline Beecham; dtca4, Lederle; dtca5, Connaught; dtce pmsv, Institut Pasteur; dtce, Aventis; dtce, Behring; dtce, Connaught; dtce, Lederle","Amvax; Aventis; Aventis; Behring; Biocine; Connaught; Connaught; Connaught; Institut Pasteur; Institut Pasteur; Lederle; Lederle; SmithKline Beecham; SmithKline Beecham","","","Lapin J., Whooping cough, 1, (1943); Arico B., Gross R., Smida J., Rappuoli R., Evolutionary relationships in the genus Bordetella, Mol Microbiol, 1, pp. 301-308, (1987); Hoag W.B., General considerations concerning pertussis, with special emphasis on vaccine therapy - Prophylatic and curative, Am Med, pp. 255-265, (1916); Masden T., Vaccination against whooping cough, JAMA, 101, pp. 187-188, (1933); Pillemer L., Blum L., Lepow I.H., Protective antigen of Haemophilus pertussis, Lancet, 1, pp. 1257-1260, (1954); Cravitz L., Cauley J.H., Pertussis immunization program of the Boston Health Department.

One of the goals of this proposal is to ensure that pedestrians and cyclists are covered by the compulsory insurance of the vehicle involved in the accident. Examples of legislation which has already sought to do so includes the French law (Loi Badinter in France) and Swedish law. It may be less well-known that Article 29bis of the Belgian Act of 21 November 1989 on the insurance against civil liability regarding the use of motor vehicles is another example of national legislation providing such coverage, not only of pedestrians and cyclists but also of motor vehicle passengers themselves. Belgian law provides a specific compensation for bodily injury and death incurred by every victim of a traffic accident involving a motor vehicle, with the exception of the driver. This is so regardless of whether the driver or the victim is at fault or not. This paper gives a brief overview of the key features of this compensation regime and its subsequent statutory changes and places it within the context of the case law. © 2003 SAGE Publications.","","","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","1023263X","","","","English","Maastricht J.

Pearl Izumi features EKG (engineered knit garment) technology in its tango cycling 'skort', a wrap-around shorts/skirt combination. UV protection is also important with Polartec Power Dry 100% polyester fabrics produced in three categories. Bike wear from Austrian manufacturer Loffler is described. Fusion technology is used in bike shorts by Pearl Izumi and Odlo. Elastic knit fabrics are discussed such as Cordura, used by Gonso. Greater attention to women's wear is evident with Fila products an example. Functional fabrics such as Phaseable from Sympatex Technologies are included, and laminates from W L Gore.

General statistics indicate that road accident fatalities are quite comparable for children between the three users'categories - pedestrians, cyclists and automobile occupants. In order to propose some technical improvements for primary as well as secondary safety, it is important to better specify the real distribution of risks, the circumstances and injury consequences of accidents. An epidemiological investigation has been set up with its sources at the hospital emergency services specialised for children. The first results obtained at the hospital Marseille Nord are discussed and let emphasize on the higher severity of head injuries, particularly with unconsciousness for the pedestrian. Lower limbs lesions were mainly fractures for the pedestrian while the 2 wheeler suffered fractures to both upper and lower limbs. The child car occupant, sitting in the rear seat, was injured by impact against the front seats and the car structure. The thoraco-abdominal viscera were very seldom injured. © 1983 Copyright Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.","","Emergency services; Fracture; Hospitals; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Abdominal viscera; Car structures; General statistics; Head injuries; Real distribution; Road users; Secondary safety; Technical improvement; Accidents","","","","","","","","","","SAE International","","","","","","01487191","","","","English","SAE Techni.

Purpose: This study was undertaken to determine whether hyperferritinemia corresponded to elevated body iron stores or not and, affirmatively, what were its mechanism, its its clinical consequences, and its spontaneous course. Methods: 83 elite road male cyclists presenting with hyperferritinemia, defined as serum ferritin level greater than 300 μg·L-1, were studied with respect to consumption of iron and other drugs, serum iron tests, HFE mutations, and hepatic iron concentration (HIC; N < 35 μmol·g-1 dry weight). Results: All cyclists were asymptomatic and had normal physical and cardiac examination. Their median (range) serum ferritin, serum iron, and transferrin saturation levels were 504 μg·L-1 (306-1671).20 μmol·L-1 (8.5-36.3), and 39% (20-76), respectively. HIC was increased in 24/27 up to 187 μmol·g-1. Allelic frequency of the H63D mutation was increased in cyclists when compared to controls (P = 0.04). However, iron tests did not differ according to HFE genotypes. Most cyclists (89%) had been supplemented with iron. The median iron supplementation was 25.5 g (range: 1.4-336) and correlated well (P = 0.002) with serum ferritin. Evolution of serum ferritin levels did not differ whether cyclists had been continuing iron supplementation or not. Conclusion: Hyperferritinemia in elite road cyclists accounted for increased body iron stores caused by and persisting after cessation of excessive iron supplementation. Even when mild, iron excess may expose to long-term complications and should be removed, at least at the time when professional cyclists retire.

Summer sports equipment is also highlighted, particularly fishing rods - early composite rods of glass/polyester prepreg construction evolved into glass/epoxy prepreg. Carbon fibre prepreg is now a popular option for fly rods with the advantages detailed. The player's ability to feel the response of a golf club, tennis racquet or baseball is vital to sporting performance. Composite golf club shafts are described, with the bubble shaft concept pioneered by Salomon Group. IsoGrid technology from US company Vyatek Sports is also described. Racing bikes incorporate composites, particularly those based on carbon fibre reinforcements. Hexcel have long supplied to Corima, France, who make high performance bikes.

For example, the best performance on the classical ascent in the Tour de France on the Alpe d'Huez, 14.5 km with 1130 m climbing, is held by Marco Pantani with 37:35 mins. A moderately trained recreational biker will have around 90 mins for the same ascent.

In the present series of experiments, we performed a non-invasive investigation using functional magnetic resonance imaging and surface electromyography to determine the pattern of activity of lower limb muscles during two different exhausting pedaling exercises in eight French professional cyclists. Each subject performed an incremental exercise during which electromyographic activity of eight lower limb muscles and respiratory variables were recorded. After a 3-h recovery period, transverse relaxation times (T2) were measured before and just after a standardized constant-load maximal exercise in order to quantify exercise-related T2 changes. The global EMG activity illustrated by the root mean square clearly showed a large inter-individual difference during the incremental exercise regardless of the investigated muscle (variation coefficient up to 81%). In addition, for most of the muscles investigated, the constant-load exercise induced T2 increases, which varied noticeably among the subjects. This high level of variation in the recruitment of lower limb muscles in professional cyclists during both incremental and constant-load exercises is surprising given the homogeneity related to maximal oxygen consumption and training volume. The high degree of expertise of these professional cyclists was not linked to the production of a common pattern of pedaling and our results provide an additional evidence that the nervous system has multiple ways of accomplishing a given motor task, as has been suggested previously by neural control theorists and experimentalists. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Electromyography; Elite cyclists; Magnetic resonance imaging; Transverse relaxation time","adult; article; athlete; calculation; constants and coefficients; controlled study; correlation analysis; cycling; electromyography; ethnology; experimentation; France; functional assessment; human; human experiment; human tissue; leg muscle; loading test; male; motor activity; motor control; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; muscle training; nervous system; non invasive measurement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen consumption; priority journal; quantitative analysis; relaxation time; respiratory tract parameters; standardization; task performance; theory","","","ME3000P8, Mega Electronics, Finland; Vision Imaging System, Siemens, Germany","Mega Electronics, Finland; Siemens, Germany","ASO-Société du Tour de France; Amaury Sport Organisation","Acknowledgements This study was supported by a grant from Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO-Société du Tour de France).

In the periods 1977-1983 and 1987-1990, 4490 facial traumas were admitted. Of these 447 were due to alpine sports activities. Analysis of the aetiology, the type of patients and the observed lesions provides interesting information concerning the evolution of this kind of trauma. The incidence of trauma caused by sport of all types has doubled from 12% to 23% while that caused by mountain sports specifically remains stable. The AA noted an important regression of winter sports accidents (from 84% to 49%) whereas summer sports furnish an increasing number of patients (from 15% to 50%). Mountain bikes are a major source of accidents as traumas caused by this sport increased from 0% in the first period to 9% in the second (33% in 1991). The AA stress the need for adequate protective measures for this new sporting activity.","alpine traumatology; facial trauma; mountain accidents; ski accidents","adolescent; adult; conference paper; controlled study; cycling; female; france; human; major clinical study; male; maxillofacial injury; mountaineering; skiing; sport injury; traumatology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00247782","","LYCHA","","French","LYON CHIR.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029831994"

A prospective and descriptive epidemiological study was conducted in the Paris area, between January 1st and December 31st 1996, in a population composed of 1,647 lift and 1,773 climatic engineering maintenance operators. Twenty nine occupational physicians completed a standardized questionnaire for each W.I. (except distance from home to work and from work to home). A panel of experts determined the degree of imputation in the W.I. occurrence of the device object of maintenance. A total of 323 W.I. was collected: 186 among lift maintenance operators and 137 among climatic engineering maintenance operators. No fatal injury was observed, one out of two injuries led to sick leave, one third more than 8 days The half of W.I. (168) occurred in the technical area. Experts imputed the device object of maintenance in 93 W.I. These W.I. implicated lift maintenance operators as much as controls. Lesion locations were similar (hands, eyes). However, low back pain was more frequent among climatic engineering maintenance operators who had more sick leave over 8 days. The injuries linked to the device occurred more often in the morning and in August/September for climatic engineering maintenance operators, while peaks of frequency were in the afternoon and in April/October among lift maintenance operators. These results are discussed. For all 323 work injuries, the primary difference between the two groups was the occurrence of public highway injuries, 7 times higher among lift maintenance operators than among controls. Currently, lift maintenance operators use quite systematically motorized bikes in the Paris area while climatic engineering maintenance operators use cars. In conclusion, if lift maintenance brings about more W.I. than climatic engineering maintenance, the lift itself does not seem to induce more injuries than the climatic device. The difference results from injuries occurred on the public highway.","","adult; aged; article; comparative study; controlled study; engineering; eye injury; female; France; hand injury; human; low back pain; major clinical study; male; occupational accident; operator; seasonal variation","","","","","","","Chaudron B., Crestois M., Ozkan Rabret E., Peyronnet M., Venner S., L'agent de maintenance et de réparation d'ascenseurs en région parisienne, Cahiers de Médecine Interprofessionnelle(C.A.M.I.P.), 4, pp. 449-456, (1994); Haentjens C., Agent d'exploitation en génie climatique, Cahiers de Médecine Interprofessionnelle (C.A.M.I.P.), 4, pp. 481-488, (1992); Goldberg M., S.

The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of such dietary manipulation during 2 days of long-lasting exhausting cycling on food and fluid intake, energy balance, nitrogen balance, and nutrient oxidation. Thirteen highly trained cyclists were divided into two subgroups receiving ad libitum either a primarily maltodextrin-based beverage (Mf) (20% w/v, 85% maltodextrin, 15% fructose) or a 50/50% composed fructose-maltodextrin (FM) beverage in addition to their normal diet. The study was performed during a 7-day stay in a respiration chamber (2 preparation days, 1 standardized resting day, 2 cycling days, 1.5 standardized recovery days), allowing for continuous gas analysis, weighed food and fluid intake procedure, and collection of excretes. The data of this study were compared with data from the same subjects receiving a normal CHO-rich diet (N) (60 En%) in a separate experiment. The results showed that the cyclists receiving Mf were able to maintain EB during sustained exercise days in contrast to when receiving N and to subjects receiving FM. With Mf treatment CHO intake increased, up to 80 En% (17.5 ± 1.0 g·kg-1 BW) and carbohydrate balance remained positive. The subjects receiving FM had the largest CHO oxidation, calculated from R. Protein oxidation significantly increased in N and FM as a result of exercise but not in Mf. The latter subjects were in slightly negative nitrogen balance at a protein intake level of 1.4 g·kg-1 BW. The results show that supplementation with maltodextrin beverages is an adequate measure to maintain EB and CHO balance and furthermore that increased CHO intake induces protein sparing. The protein requirement while being in energy and carbohydrate balance during days of sustained exhausting cycling was in the range of 1.5-1.8 g·kg-1 BW.","","carbohydrate; adult; caloric intake; controlled study; cycling; diet; energy balance; fluid intake; human; male; nitrogen balance; normal human; nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01724622","","IJSMD","2663742","English","INT.

Subjects wore a heart rate telemeter during 22 competition stages and recorded data were analysed using computer software. Two reference heart rates (corresponding to the first and second ventilatory thresholds or VT1 and VT2) were used to establish three levels of exercise intensity defined as phases I (< VT1), II (VT1 -VT2) and III (< VT2). The average total time spent by each subject in each of the 3 phases respectively was approximately 71, 23 and 8 h. The relative contributions of each phase were 70, 23 and 7%. The percentage relative contribution of each phase was significantly different (p < 0.01) in each of the competition stages (time trials, flat stages, 'high-mountain' stages and 'medium-mountain' stages). Exercise intensity was particularly high during the time trials and high mountain stages. It may be concluded that during an endurance event such as the Tour de France, although the overall contribution of moderate (VT1 to VT2) or high intensity exercise (> VT2) is substantially lower than that of light, aerobic exercise (< VT1), a clear distinction must be made between the different type of stages (i.e. easy, flat parcours vs mountain stages or time trials) and the role of each cyclist in the team must be also considered.","Cycling; Heart rate; Physiology; Ventilatory threshold","adult; article; computer program; cycling; exercise; heart rate; human; male; normal human; telemetry","","","","","","","Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, (1986); Bonetti A., Tirelli F., Albertini R., Monica C., Monica M., Tredici G., Serum cardiac troponin T after repeated endurance exercise events, Int J Sports Med, 17, pp. 259-262, (1996); Boulay M.R., Physiological monitoring of elite cyclists.

Armstrong's articulation of multiple, competing identifications is consistent with a postmodern notion of fractured, incomplete identity. However, following Butler, identity can be seen as contested, negotiated, and often hegemonic. Drawing from the emerging field of cyborgology, and the work of Birrell and McDonald, the authors construct a parallel cyborg “counternarrative” alongside the popular Armstrong story. By interrogating Armstrong's story through the lens of cyborg theory, the authors will explore and articulate alternative meanings/readings of Armstrong's narrative of self as represented in his book and, finally, suggest that Armstrong's story can be read as an exemplar of the postmodern cyborg sporting hero. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

Methods: The 1989-1993 files of the NZ Hospital Discharge Database were accessed to identify and analyze trauma- related admissions of adolescents residing in NZ's largest metropolitan region. Results: The estimated 9569 hospitalizations for injury accounted for one-fourth of all adolescent admissions in the region, a mean annual hospitalization rate of 1292/100,000 population and a minimum annual cost of NZ $5.8 million for in-patient care. Males and indigenous Maori youth had comparatively higher rates of hospitalizations for most major causes of injury. Falls, pedal cyclist injury, cuts, and piercing injuries were leading causes of hospitalization for trauma in early adolescence. Admission rates for motorcylist and other motor vehicle occupant trauma and self-inflicted injury increased substantially among older adolescents. Sport and recreational activities comprised at least one-sixth of injury admissions. Conclusions: The overall rates of injury resulting in hospitalization among Auckland adolescents were comparable to those reported from Australia and France, but higher than those from the United States, Canada, and Israel. By identifying priority issues and high-risk groups, this study provides a foundation for regional injury control initiatives. It also demonstrates the utility and limitations of E-coded hospital discharge registries in defining the burden of serious nonfatal trauma.","Adolescents; E-code; Epidemiology; Gender differences; Hospitalization; Injury; New Zealand; Urban","Adolescent; Age Distribution; Female; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Male; New Zealand; Patient Admission; Registries; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Urban Population; Wounds and Injuries; accident prevention; adolescent; article; automutilation; cost of illness; female; high risk population; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; injury; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; priority journal; sport injury; traffic accident","","","","","Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation of New Zealand; Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy; Northern Regional Health Authority of New Zealand; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC","The study and the principal author were supported in part by the Northern Regional Health Authority of New Zealand, the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation of New Zealand, the Johns Hopkins Center for Adolescent Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (funded by the Prevention Centers Program, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC), and the Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy (funded by the CDC).","Maskill C., A Health Profile of New Zealand Adolescents, (1991); Hospital and Selected Morbidity Data 1991, (1992); Mortality Data 1991, (1993); Guria J.C., Length of hospitalization - an indicator of social costs of disabilities from traffic injuries, Accid Anal Prev, 22, pp. 379-389, (1990); Barker M., Power C., Disability in young adults: The role of injuries, J Epidemiol Commun Health, 47, pp. 349-354, (1993); Runyan C.W., Gerken E.A., Epidemiology and prevention of adolescent injury: A review and a research agenda, JAMA, 262, pp. 2273-2279, (1989); Langley J.D., McLoughlin E., Injury mortality and morbidity in New Zealand, Accid Anal Prev, 21, pp. 243-254, (1989); Baranick J.I., Chatterjee B.F., Greene Y.C., Et al., North Eastern Trauma Study: I.

It is generally recognized that these data are incomplete but no measurement has been made of the degree of under-reporting and thus of associated biases. This study aims to demonstrate and quantify these biases. Methods: The study compares, after data linkage, the 10 202 people reported injured or killed in 1996 in the medical road accident victims Register in the Département du Rhône (France), with the 4 572 victims reported by the police during the same year and in the same area. This Département was chosen, as it is the only region in France where these two independent data sources coexist. Two types of possible biases are studied: injury severity classification bias and selection bias induced by underreporting. Results: The study shows that the definition of ""serious injury"" used by the police exaggerates the severity of the victim's condition in over half the cases. This bias depends on road user group. This bias is maximum for pedestrians: compared to a slightly injured car occupant, a pedestrian with the same injury severity level has significantly more chance to be considered as severely injured (RR=1.78; 95% CI: 1.11-2.87). Conversely, significant selection biases are related to data collection by the police. The multivariate analysis shows that the underreporting of victims increases if no third party is involved (i.e. without any other vehicle or pedestrian), and reduces with injury severity. It also varies by road user group (with the largest underreporting for cyclists). Among the most seriously injured in accidents involving third parties, motor cyclists and car users are the most reported category and pedestrians the least (RR=0.80; 95% CI: 0.70-0.92). Biases in Register selection are much more limited and basically concern underreporting of victims of minor accidents who did not require medical care. Conclusions: This study confirms and quantifies misleading distortions in police statistics used to assess road accidents. These results concern the relevant indicators to be used to define road safety issues.","Abbreviated injury scale; Bias (Epidemiology); France; Medical record linkage; Multivariate analysis; Traffic accidents","Accidents, Traffic; Bias (Epidemiology); France; Humans; Registries; article; cycling; France; injury; injury scale; mortality; police; traffic accident; traffic safety; epidemiology; human; register; statistics","","","","","","","Underreporting of road traffic accidents recorded by the police, at the international level, (1994); Elvik R., Mysen B., Incomplete accident reporting - Meta-analysis of studies made in 13 countries, Transp Res Rec, 1665, pp. 133-140, (1999); Laumon B., Martin J.L., Collet P., Et al., A French road accident trauma registry: First results, Proceedings of the 41st annual Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, pp. 127-137, (1997); The Abbreviated Injury Scale, 1990 Revision, (1990); Jaro M.A., Advances in record-linkage methodology as applied to matching the 1985 census of Tampa, Florida, JASA, 84, pp. 414-420, (1989); Copes W.S., Stark M.M., Lawnick M.M., Linking data from national trauma and rehabilitation registries, J Trauma, 40, pp. 428-436, (1996); Rosman D.L., The feasibility of linking hospital and police road crash casualty records without names, Accid Anal Prev, 28, pp. 271-274, (1996); Garber B.G., Hebert P.C., Wells G., Et al., Validation of trauma and injury severity score in blunt trauma patients by using a Canadian trauma registry, J Trauma, 40, pp. 733-737, (1996); McCullagh P., Nelder J.A., Generalized Linear Models.

Methods: The cyclists are divided into three groups according to their age and sports category (24 are professional, 22 amateur and 26 junior). They carried out a progressive test to exhaustion on a specific cycloergometer (Orion. France), starting at a power output of 100 watts and increasing 50 watts every four minutes. VO2 was measured breath by breath by a metabolimeter (V max 29, Sensor Medics USA). At the end of each of the four minute steps the subject is asked about his RPE using the 6-20 Borg scale. Results: Professional cyclists showed VO2 max, VO2/kg. and maximum power output significantly higher than the other groups, while there are no significantly differences between amateurs and juniors. VO2 max and RPE are significantly different, in all the categories, at high loads. No significant differences are found between RPE and %VO2 max. RPE and heart rate (HR) are significantly different between professionals and juniors. RPE and %FC max are significantly different with low loads, but not at high loads. In the same way, RPE/w and RPE(w/kg) are significantly different in all categories. Conclusions: We conclude that professional road cyclists reached greater VO2 max, VO2 max/kg and maximum power higher than the other categories. So, therefore these parameters are therefore good as performance indicators. By means of the rating of perceived exertion we can prescribe the exercise intensity in each category. The RPE is a valid method for the regulation of exercise intensity in high level cycling, although different categories and age must be borne in mind, as it is not possible to compare the data of groups of high level cyclists with those who have a lower sports level.","Age; Cycling; Oxygen uptake; Perceived exertion; Physical training","adult; age; article; bicycle ergometry; controlled study; cycling; exercise; human; lung ventilation perfusion ratio; major clinical study; oxygen consumption; physical performance; scoring system; training","","","","","","","Aragones M., Casajus J.A., Modificaciones antropométricas debidas al entrenamiento.

Instead of a chimney sweep competing during his free time (as in 1903), the recent winner is a highly trained, professional cyclist whose entire life-style has been dedicated to reach his pinnacle during this event. The TDF has been held successfully for 100 years, but the application of the physiologic sciences to the sport is a relatively recent phenomenon. Although some historical reports help to understand the unique physiological characteristics of this race, scientific studies were not available in Sports Science/ Applied Physiology journals until the 1990s. The aim of this article is to review the history of the TDF. Special emphasis is placed on the last decade where classic physiology has been integrated into applied scientific cycling data.","Endurance exercise; Physiology; Professional cycling","Bicycling; Cardiovascular Physiology; Competitive Behavior; Doping in Sports; France; Humans; Male; Nutrition Physiology; Physical Education and Training; Physical Endurance; anthropometry; athlete; competition; cycling; data analysis; demography; history of medicine; human; hydration; lifestyle; literature; nutrition; review; sport; sports medicine","","","","","","","Abergel E., Linhart A., Chatellier G., Gariepy J., Ducardonnet A., Diebold B., Menard J., Vascular and cardiac remodeling in world class professional cyclists, Am Heart J, 136, pp. 818-823, (1998); Anholm J.D., Milne E.N., Stark P., Bourne J.C., Friedman P., Radiographic evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema after exercise at altitude, J Appl Physiol, 86, pp. 503-509, (1999); Augendre J., L'histoire, Les Archives, pp. 1-168, (2001); Bassett Jr. D.R., Kyle C.R., Passfield L., Broker J.P., Burke E., Comparing cycling world records, 1967-1996: Modelling with empirical data, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 31, pp. 1665-1676, (1999); Chicharro J.L., Hoyos J., Bandres F., Terrados N., Fernandez B., Lucia A., Thyroid hormone levels during a three-week professional road cycling competition, Horm Res, 56, pp. 159-164, (2001); Christensen E.H., Hansen O., Hypoglykämie, arbeitsfähigkeit und ermüdung, Skand Archiv Physiol, pp. 172-179, (1939); Coyle E.F., Coggan A.R., Hemmert M.K., Ivy J.L., Muscle glycogen utilization during prolonged strenuous exercise when fed carbohydrate, J Appl Physiol, 61, pp. 165-172, (1986); Coyle E.F., Sidossis L.S., Horowitz J.F., Beltz J.D., Cycling efficiency is related to the percentage of type I muscle fibers, Med Sci Sports Exerc, 24, pp. 782-788, (1992); Eichner E.R., Better dead than second, J Lab Clin Med, 120, pp. 359-360, (1992); Ekblom B., Berglund B., Effect of erythropoietin administration on maximal aerobic power, Scand J Med Sci Sports, 1, pp. 88-93, (1991); Fagard R.H., Athlete's heart: A meta-analysis of the echocardiographic experience, Int J Sports Med, 17, (1996); Faria I.E., Energy expenditure, aerodynamics and medical problems in cycling.

Furthermore, from the age of 5 onwards, accidents account for approximately 50% of deaths. This illustrates the absolute necessity for effective prevention which should be applied to all causes of accidents and above all road accidents which alone account for approximately 50% of accidental deaths with marked predominance for male subjects. Child pedestrians are often involved in accidents at a very young age (108 deaths from 0 to 4 years of age among boys and 52 among girls). These figures exceed those for adults whereas young children are less often compelled to travel on foot. These accidents are therefore due to poor supervision. Between the ages of 5 and 9, the situation is worse and accidents involving pedestrians in this age group are more common than in any other. Specific steps should be taken to ensure safety both on the way to school and elsewhere, and it should be strictly forbidden for children to play on the street. Child cyclists begin to be involved in accidents towards the age of 5 years but the highest incidence occurs in the 10 to 14 year old age group since it is in this age group that fully one quarter of all bicycle accidents occur. Should it not be necessary to introduce strict control and some form of training at school? Adolescents who ride motorcycles or drive cars run an extremely serious risk: 22,000 dead and seriously injured between the ages of 15 and 19 in 1972. The problem cannot be solved simply through individual efforts but must be approached in depth, considering all its sociological and psychological implications.","","accident; age; child; childhood; epidemiology; injury; mortality; statistics; traffic accident","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00351644","","REVPB","","French","REV.

Approximately 30 000 to 35 000km are cycled each year in training and competition and some races, such as the Tour de France last 21 days (∼ 100 hours of competition) during which professional cyclists (PC) must cover >3500km. In some phases of such a demanding sport, on the other hand, exercise intensity is surprisingly high, since PC must complete prolonged periods of exercise (i.e. time trials, high mountain ascents) at high percentages (∼90%) of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) [above the anaerobic threshold (AT)]. Although numerous studies have analysed the physiological responses of elite, amateur level road cyclists during the last 2 decades, their findings might not be directly extrapolated to professional cycling. Several studies have recently shown that PC exhibit some remarkable physiological responses and adaptations such as: an efficient respiratory system (i.e. lack of 'tachypnoeic shift' at high exercise intensities); a considerable reliance on fat metabolism even at high power outputs; or several neuromuscular adaptations (i.e. a great resistance to fatigue of slow motor units). This article extensively reviews the different responses and adaptations (cardiopulmonary system, metabolism, neuromuscular factors or endocrine system) to this sport. A special emphasis is placed on the evaluation of performance both in the laboratory (i.e. the controversial Conconi test, distinction between climbing and time trial ability, etc.) and during actual competitions such as the Tour de France.","","adaptation;

Methods and Results: The aim of the study was to evaluate cardiac and carotid artery changes induced by professional cycling. We collected M-mode left ventricle and B- mode right common carotid artery data from 149 male professional cyclists before the 1995 'Tour de France' race and 52 male control subjects. LV mass indexed to body surface area in cyclists was double that in control subjects, with no overlap of 95% confidence intervals (cyclists 100.9 to 187 g/m2 and control subjects 51.8 to 96.3 g/m2). Both mean arterial diameter and mean arterial diastolic intima-media thickness (IMT) were 13% higher in cyclists than in control subjects, with overlap of 95% confidence intervals (for arterial IMT 0.45 to 0.65 mm in cyclists and 0.38 to 0.60 mm in control subjects). Conclusions: Our results suggest that intense cycling has an effect on the cardiovascular system, more pronounced on the left ventricle and less pronounced on large arteries. Nevertheless, athletic training should be considered as a potential determinant of carotid modification.","","adult; artery diameter; article; athlete; B scan; carotid artery disease; clinical article; cycling; echocardiography; endurance; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle remodeling; human; male; priority journal; risk factor; training","","","","","","","","","","Mosby Inc.","","","","","","00028703","","AHJOA","9812076","English","Am.

The course includes 30 mountains, the highest of which reaches an altitude of approximately 2700 m. The energy expenditure values of these cyclists range from a mean of 25.4 MJ/day to peak values of 32.7 MJ/day. These are the highest values that have ever been reported for a period longer than seven days. On the basis of the food records of 5 cyclists, it turned out that 62 En.% is derived from CHO, 15 En.% from protein, and 23 En.% from fat. Since the food choice is primarily focused on digestibility and energy content, this results in a frequent consumption of sweet cakes and CHO-rich fluids. Some 49% of the energy is consumed in between meals. Such a nutritional pattern leads to a lowering of the nutrient density especially with respect to the B-vitamins. Intake of vitamins B1, B2, B6, and C, including contribution from enriched sport drinks, was 1.97 mg, 4.96 mg, 2.40 mg, and 158 mg, respectively. Besides this, intramuscular injections of megadosis vitamins of B1, B2, B6, nicotinamide, pantothenic acid, and especially B12 did increase the intake drastically. This was reflected in high blood concentrations of vitamins. Except for folic acid, vitamins (B1, B2, B6, and B12) exceeded the upper limits of the values from a reference group, particularly B12, which exceeded the reference values by up to 400%. During the Tour, vitamin concentrations remained essentially unchanged.","","Bicycling; Energy Metabolism; Food, Fortified; Human; Male; Physical Endurance; Vitamins; vitamin; bicycle; diet supplementation; energy metabolism; human; male; physical stress; review","","Vitamins, ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03730883","","","2535605","English","Int J Vitam Nutr Res Suppl","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024310630"
